When the sky is split,
when the planets are scattered,
when the oceans are gushed forth,
when the graves are overturned,
the soul shall know what it has done, the former and the latter.
O human! What has deceived you concerning your Generous Lord
who created you, formed you and proportioned you?
In whatever shape He will He could surely have fashioned you.
Rather, you belied the Recompense.
Yet over you there are watchers,
noble scribes
who know of all that you do.
Indeed, the righteous shall (live) in bliss.
But the wicked, indeed they shall be in the Fiery Furnace,
roasting in it on the Day of Recompense
and from it they shall never be absent.
What could let you know what the Day of Recompense is!
Again, what could let you know what the Day of Recompense is!
It is the Day when no soul can do a thing for another soul. That Day, the command belongs to Allah.
