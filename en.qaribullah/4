O people, fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul. From it He created its spouse, and from both of them scattered many men and women. Fear Allah, by whom you ask one another, and (fear) the wombs (lest you sever its relationship). Allah is ever watching over you.
Give the orphans their wealth. Do not exchange the evil for the good, nor consume their wealth with your wealth. Surely, that is a great sin.
If you fear that you cannot act justly towards the orphans, then marry such women as seem good to you; two, three, four of them. But if you fear that you cannot do justice, then one only, or, those you possess. It is likelier then that you will not be partial.
Give women their dowries freely, but if they are pleased to offer you any of it, consume it good and smooth.
Do not give the (orphaned) fools your wealth with which Allah has entrusted you for (their) support, and provide for them and clothe them from it, and speak to them with kind words.
And test the orphans until they reach (the age of) marriage. If you perceive in them right judgment, hand over to them their wealth, and do not consume it wastefully, nor hastily before they are grown. And whosoever is rich let him abstain, if poor, let him consume with kindness. When you hand over to them their wealth, take witness over them; it is sufficient that Allah is the Reckoner.
Men shall have a share in what their parents and kinsmen leave, and women shall have a share in what their parents and kinsmen leave, whether it is little or abundant, it is an obligated share.
If relatives, orphans, or the needy are present at the division (of the inheritance), provide for them out of it, and speak to them in kind words.
And let them fear, who, if they themselves left behind weak offspring, would be afraid for them, and let them fear Allah and speak exactly.
Those who consume the wealth of orphans wrongfully, only consume fire in their bellies, and they shall roast in the Blaze.
Allah charges you concerning your children, for a male like the share of two females. If they are women, above two, they shall have two thirds of what he left, but if she is one, then to her a half. While for his parents, to each one of the two a sixth of what he left, if he has a child. But if he has no child and his heirs are his parents, his mother shall have a third. If he has siblings, to his mother a sixth after any bequest he had bequeathed, or any debt. Your fathers and your children, you do not know which of them is nearer in benefit to you. This is an obligation from Allah. Surely, Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
For you half of what your wives leave if they have no child. If they have a child, a quarter of what they leave shall be yours after any bequest she had bequeathed, or any debt. And for them (the females) they shall inherit one quarter of what you leave if you have no child. If you have a child, they shall inherit one eighth, after any bequest you had bequeathed, or any debt. If a man or a woman have no direct heirs, but have a brother or a sister, to each of the two a sixth. If they are more than that, they shall equally share the third, after any bequest that he had bequeathed or any debt without harm. This is an obligation from Allah. He is the Knower, the Clement.
Such are the Bounds of Allah. He who obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens underneath which rivers flow. That is a great wining.
And he who disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His Bounds, He will admit him to a Fire and shall live in it for ever. For him, there is a humiliating punishment.
If any of your women commit indecency, call in four witnesses from among yourselves against them, if they testify, confine them to their houses till death overtakes them or till Allah makes for them a way.
If two among you commit it punish them both. If they repent and make amends, leave them alone. Allah is the Relenter, the Merciful.
(Allah accepts) the repentance from only those who commit evil in ignorance and then quickly turn to Him in repentance. Allah will relent towards them. Allah is Knowing, Wise.
(Allah will accept) no repentance from those who do evil deeds until death comes to one of them, he says: 'Now I repent' Nor those who die unbelieving. For those We have prepared a painful punishment.
Believers, it is unlawful for you to inherit women forcefully, neither bar them, in order that you go off with part of what you have given them, except when they commit a clear indecency. Live with them honorably. If you hate them, it may be that you hate something which Allah has set in it much good.
If you wish to take a wife in the place of another wife, and you have given to one a Qintar (98, 841. 6 lbs.) so do not take from it anything. What, will you take it by way of calumny and a clear sin!
How can you take it back when you have reached one another (sexually) and they have taken from you a strong covenant!
And do not marry women your fathers married unless it is a thing of the past surely that was an indecency, hated, and a way of evil.
Forbidden to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts and maternal aunts, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your mothers who have given suck to you, your suckling sisters, your wives mothers, and your stepdaughters who are in your care from your wives with whom you have lain, but if you have never lain with them it is no fault in you. (Also forbidden to you) are the wives of your sons who are of your loins, and to take to you two sisters together unless it is a thing of the past. Allah is the Forgiver and the Most Merciful.
And (forbidden to you) are married women, except those whom your right hand owns. Such Allah has written for you. Lawful to you beyond all that, is that you can seek using your wealth in marriage and not fornication. So whatever you have enjoyed from them give them their obligated wage. And there is no fault in you in what ever you mutually agree after the obligation. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
If any one of you do not have the affluence to be able marry free believing women, (let him marry) from among the believing women that your right hand owns. Allah knows best your belief, you are from each other. Marry them with the permission of their people and give them their wages (dowry) honorably being women in marriage and chaste, not taking lovers. If, after marriage they commit adultery, they shall be liable to half the punishment of a married (free) woman. That is for those of you who fear fornication, but it is better for you to be patient. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
Allah wishes to make this clear to you and to guide you along the ways of those who have gone before you, and turns towards you. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
Allah wishes to turn towards you, but those who follow their lower desires wish you to greatly swerve away.
Allah wishes to lighten for you (the jurisprudence), and humans are created weak.
Believers, do not consume your wealth among yourselves in falsehood, except there be trading by your mutual agreement. And do not kill yourselves. Allah is the Most Merciful to you.
But whosoever does that in transgression and wrongfully We shall roast him in the Fire. That is an easy matter for Allah.
If you avoid the major sins that are forbidden to you, We shall pardon your evil deeds and admit you by an entrance of honor.
Do not wish for the bounty which Allah has preferred one of you above another. For men is a share of what they earn, and for women is a share of what they earn. Ask Allah of His Bounty. Allah has knowledge of all things.
To everyone we have made heirs of that which parents and kinsmen leave, and those with whom you have sworn an agreement, so give to them their share. Allah is Witness over everything.
Men are the maintainers of women for that Allah has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have spent of their wealth. Righteous women are obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah has guarded. Those from whom you fear rebelliousness, admonish them and desert them in the bed and smack them (without harshness). Then, if they obey you, do not look for any way against them. Allah is High, Great.
If you fear a breach between them send for an arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people. If both wish reconciliation, Allah will bring success between them. Allah is the Knower, the Aware.
Worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him. Be kind to parents and near kinsmen, to the orphans and to the needy, to your neighbor who is your kindred, and to the neighbor at your far side, and the companion at your side, and to the destitute traveler, and to that which your right hands owns. Allah does not love he who is proud and struts,
(or) those who are greedy and order other people to be greedy, who themselves conceal the bounty that Allah has given them. And We have prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers.
And those who spend their wealth to showoff to people and neither believe in Allah nor in the Last Day. Whosoever has satan for a companion, he is an evil companion.
What (harm) could befall them if they believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent of what Allah provided them with? Allah is Knowledgeable of them all.
Surely, Allah shall not harm so much as the weight of an atom, and if it is a good deed He will double it, and give from His Own a great wage.
How then shall it be when We bring forward from every nation a witness, and bring you (Prophet Muhammad) to witness against those!
On that Day those who disbelieved, and have disobeyed the Messenger (Muhammad) will wish that the earth might be leveled with them, and they will not conceal a statement from Allah.
Believers, do not come close to prayer when you are drunk, until you know what you are saying, nor when you are in a state of impurity, unless you are crossing through the way (prayer area) until you have bathed yourselves. If you are ill or on a journey, or if any of you comes from the toilet or you have touchedwomen, and you cannot find water, so touch pure dust and wipe your faces and your hands. Allah is the Pardoner, the Forgiver.
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book was given purchasing error and wishing that you should err from the Path?
But Allah knows best your enemies. It is sufficient that Allah is the Guardian, and it is sufficient that Allah is the Helper.
Some Jews tampered with the words (altering) their places saying: 'We have heard and we disobey' and 'Hear, without hearing' and 'Observe us (Ra'ina, in Hebrew means evil) ', twisting with their tongues traducing religion. But if they had said: 'We have heard and obey' and 'Hear' and 'Regard us' it would have been better for them, and more upright; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe, except a few.
You, to whom the Book was given, believe in that which We have sent down confirming that which you have, before We obliterate faces and turn them on their backs, or curse them as We cursed the people of the Sabbath. And the command of Allah is done.
Allah does not forgive (the sin of inventing an) association with Him, but He forgives other (sins) to whomsoever He will. He who associates with Allah has invented a great sin.
Have you not seen those who exalt themselves? Rather, Allah purifies whom He will and they shall not be wronged a single tissue that covers a date stone.
Look how they forge lies against Allah, and it is sufficient for a clear sin.
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book was given believing in (the two statutes of Mecca) jibt and taghout and say to those who disbelieve: 'Those are more guided on the way than those who believe.'
Those are they whom Allah has cursed and whosoever Allah has cursed, you will not find any helper for him.
Or, will they have a share in the Kingdom? If so, they will not give the people the pit mark of a date stone.
Or do they envy people for the Bounty Allah has given them? We gave the family of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and a great kingdom.
There are some of them who believed in him (Prophet Muhammad), and some of them that bar from it, and Gehenna (Hell) is sufficient for a Blaze.
Those who disbelieve Our verses We will roast them in a Fire! As often as their skins are cooked, We exchange their skin with another, in order that they taste the punishment. Surely, Allah is Mighty, the Wise.
As for those who believe and do good works, We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow, they are there for eternity, and for them purified spouses. And We shall admit them into plenteous shade.
Allah orders you all to hand back trusts to their owners, and when you judge between people you judge with justice. Indeed, the best is the exhortation with which Allah exhorts you. Allah is the Hearer, the Seer.
Believers, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. Should you dispute about anything refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and the best interpretation.
Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you? They desire to be judged by the idol, although they have been commanded to disbelieve it. But satan desires to lead them astray into far error.
When it is said to them: 'Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger' you see the hypocrites completely barring the way to you.
How would it be if some affliction hit them for what their hands have forwarded? Then, they would come to you swearing by Allah, 'We sought only kindness and conciliation'
Those, Allah knows what is in their hearts, so turn away from them, and exhort them, and say to them penetrating words about themselves.
We did not send a Messenger except that he should be obeyed, by the permission of Allah. If, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you and asked Allah for forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah the Turner, the Most Merciful.
But no, by your Lord, they will not believe you until they make you the judge regarding the disagreement between them, then, they will not find in themselves any discomfort concerning your verdict, and will surrender to you in full submission.
Had We written for them, saying, 'Slay yourselves' or 'Emerge from your houses' they would not have done so, except a few of them. Yet, if they had done as they were exhorted, it would have been better for them, and stronger in firmness,
and then We would surely have given them from Our Own, a great wage,
and guided them to a Straight Path.
Whosoever obeys Allah, and the Messenger, they are with those whom Allah has favored, the Prophets, the sincere, the martyrs and the righteous, and these are the best company.
This is the Bounty of Allah. It is sufficient that Allah is the Knowledgeable.
Believers, take your precautions. March in detachments or march all together.
Surely, there are among you, he who lingers, then, if an affliction hits you, he would say: 'Allah has favored me, that I was not a martyr with them'
But, if the Bounty of Allah reaches you, he would surely say as if there had never been any affection between you and him: 'Would that I had been with them! I should have indeed won a great triumph'
So let those who sell the worldly life for the Everlasting Life fight in the way of Allah, whoever fights in the way of Allah, and is killed or conquers, We shall give him a great wage.
So why is it, that you do not fight in the way of Allah, and for the abased among men, women, and children who say: 'Our Lord, bring us out from this village whose people are harmdoers, and give to us a guardian from You, and give to us a helper from You.'
And those who believe fight in the way of Allah, but those who disbelieve fight in the way of the idol. Therefore, fight against those guided by satan. Indeed, satan's guile is always weak.
Have you not seen those to whom it has been said: 'Restrain your hands, establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity' Then, as soon as fighting is written for them, there is a party of them fearing people as they would fear Allah, or with stronger fear. And they say: 'Our Lord, why have You written fighting for us, why not postpone us to a near term' Say: 'The pleasure of this life is little. The Everlasting Life is better for the cautious. You shall not be wronged a single tissue (of the fine skin that covers a date stone).
Wherever you are, death will overtake you, even if you shall be in the fortified, high towers' If bounty reaches them, they say: 'This is from Allah' but when evil hits them, they say: 'This is from you' Say to them: 'All is from Allah' What is the matter with this people that they scarcely understand any statement.
Whatever good reaches you, it is from Allah, and whatever evil reaches you, it is from yourself. We have sent you (Prophet Muhammad) as a Messenger to humanity. Allah is sufficient for a Witness.
Whosoever obeys the Messenger, indeed he has obeyed Allah. As for those who turn away, We have not sent you to be their protector.
They say, 'Obedience' but as soon as they leave you, a party of them hide other than what they said. Allah writes down what they hide. So turn away from them, and rely on Allah. Allah is sufficient for a Guardian.
Will they not contemplate upon the Koran? If it had been from other than Allah, they would surely have found in it many contradictions.
When a matter comes to them, be it of security or fear, they broadcast it, whereas if they returned it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those of them whose task is to research it would have known it. If it was not for the Bounty of Allah and His Mercy, all but a few of you would have followed satan.
Therefore, fight in the way of Allah. You are only responsible for yourself. Urge the believers on, in order that Allah may restrain the might of those who disbelieve. Allah is stronger in might, and stronger in punishment.
Whosoever intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it, and whosoever intercedes with a bad intercession shall receive a portion of it. Allah has power over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet with better than it, or return it. Allah is the Reckoner of all things.
Allah, there is no god except He. He will gather you to the Resurrection Day, there is no doubt in it. And who is truer in statement than Allah?
What is the matter with you that you are two parties concerning the hypocrites when Allah has overthrown them for what they earned? Would you desire to guide those whom Allah has caused to be led astray? Whosoever Allah leads astray, you will not find for him a way.
They wish that you would disbelieve as they disbelieve, and then you would be equal. Therefore, do not take a guide from them until they emigrate in the way of Allah. Then, if they turn back take them and kill them wherever you find them. Do not take them for guides or helpers,
except those who join to a nation in which there is between you and them a treaty, or they come to you with their chests constricted from fighting you or fighting their nation. Had Allah willed, He would have given them power over you, and then they would have certainly fought you. Therefore, if they keep away from you and do not fight you, offering you peace, then Allah does not make any way for you against them.
You will find others desiring to be secure from you, and secure from their own nation. Whenever they are called back to sedition, they plunge into it. If they do not keep away from you and offer you peace, and restrain their hands, take them and kill them wherever you find them. Those, over them, We give you clear authority.
It is not for a believer to kill another believer, except that it is by error. Whosoever kills a believer in error, let him free a believing slave, and ransom is to be handed to his family, unless they forgo being charitable. If he belonged to a people who are your enemies and is a believer then, the setting free of a believing slave. If he belonged to a people in which there is between you and them a treaty, then a ransom is to be handed to his family and the setting free of a believing slave. But, if he does not find (the means) let him fast two consecutive months in repentance to Allah. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
The recompense for he who kills a believer deliberately is Gehenna (Hell), he is eternal there. Allah will be angry with him and will curse him and prepare for him a great punishment.
Believers, if you are journeying in the way of Allah, do not say to those who offer you peace, until it has been clarified: 'You are not believers' seeking the enjoyment of the worldly life, with Allah there are many spoils. You were like that before, and Allah has been gracious to you. Therefore let it be clarified. Surely, Allah is Aware of what you do.
Believers who stay behind, having no injury, are not equal to those who fight in the way of Allah with their wealth and their souls. Allah has preferred those who fight with their wealth and their souls a degree above those who stay behind (because of sickness). Yet to each, Allah has promised the most excellent (Paradise). And Allah has preferred those who fought over those who stayed behind with a great wage.
Ranks from Him, forgiveness and mercy. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
And the angels who take those who wronged themselves will say: 'In what condition were you' They will reply 'We were oppressed in the land' They (the angels) will say: 'Was not the earth of Allah wide enough for you in order that you migrate in it' Those, their shelter will be Gehenna (Hell), an evil arrival.
Except the men, women, and children, who, being abased have no means and they are unable to guide themselves to a way.
Those, Allah may pardon them, He is the Pardoner, the Forgiver.
Whosoever emigrates in the way of Allah shall find in the land numerous refuges and abundance. Whosoever leaves his house an immigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him, his wage shall have fallen upon Allah. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
And when you are journeying in the land, there is no fault in you that you shorten the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve will afflict you. Indeed, the unbelievers are a clear enemy for you.
When you are with them, and establish the prayer, let a party of them stand with you, and let them take their weapons. After making their prostrations, let them be behind you, and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you, taking their precautions and their weapons. Those who disbelieve wish that you should be inattentive of your weapons and your baggage, so that they might swoop upon you with one assault. But there is no fault in you if you are harmed by rain, or you are sick to lay aside your weapons, but take your precautions. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers.
When you have established the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, and on your sides. Then, when you are secure, establish the prayer, surely, prayer is timely written upon the believer.
And do not be weak in seeking out the people. If you are suffering, they are also suffering as you are suffering, but you are hoping from Allah that which they do not hope. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
Surely, We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, so that you will rule between the people by that Allah has shown you. So do not be an advocate for the traitors.
And ask the forgiveness of Allah, surely Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
And do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves, surely, Allah does not love the sinful traitor.
They seek to hide themselves from the people, but they do not hide themselves from Allah for He is with them when they hide the saying that does not please Him. Allah encompasses what they do.
There you are, you have argued on their behalf in the worldly life, but who will argue with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection! Or who will be a guardian for them?
He who does evil or wrongs himself and then asks forgiveness of Allah will find that Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
Whosoever earns a sin, he only earns it against himself. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
Whosoever earns a fault or a sin and casts it upon the innocent, indeed, he bears the slander and a clear sin.
But for the Favor of Allah to you (Prophet Muhammad) and His Mercy, a party of them intended to lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray, and they did not harm you a thing. Allah has sent down to you the Book and the Wisdom and He has taught you what you did not know. The Bounty of Allah to you is ever great.
There is no good in much of their confiding, except for he who bids to charity, honor, or reforms between people. Whosoever does that for the sake of the pleasure of Allah, We shall give him a great wage.
But whosoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has been made clear to him and follows a path other than that of the believers, We shall let him follow what he has turned to and We shall roast him in Gehenna (Hell) an evil arrival.
Allah does not forgive (the sin of inventing an) association with Him, but He forgives other sins to whomsoever He will. Whosoever associates with Allah has gone astray in far error.
Instead of Him they supplicate to none but females, and indeed they supplicate to none except the rebellious satan,
whom Allah has cursed and he (satan) said: 'Indeed, I will take to myself an appointed portion of Your worshipers,
and lead them astray. I shall fill them with fancies and order them to cut off the ears of cattle. I shall order them to alter the creation of Allah' Indeed, whosoever chooses satan for a guide, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a clear loss.
he promises them and fills them with fancies, but what satan promises them is only a delusion.
Those, their shelter will be Gehenna (Hell), and from it they shall find no refuge.
But those who believe and do good works We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow, and there they shall live for ever, the promise of Allah is true. And who is truer in speech than Allah!
It is not by your fancies, nor by the fancies of the People of the Book. Whosoever does evil shall be recompensed for it, and he will not find for himself, other than Allah, a guardian or helper.
But whosoever does good works of righteousness, whether they be a believing male or female, shall enter Paradise, and not be wronged a pit mark of a date stone.
And who is better in religion than he who submits his face to Allah, being a gooddoer, and follows the Creed of Abraham, pure in faith? Allah took Abraham for a close friend.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Allah encompasses everything.
They will ask you for a verdict concerning women. Say: "Allah decides for you concerning them, and what has been recited in the Book concerning orphaned women to whom you do not give what is written, and yet desire to marry them, and the abased children, and that you secure justice for orphans. Whatever good you do, Allah has knowledge it.
If a woman fears hatred or aversion from her husband there is no fault in them if the couple set things right between them, for reconciliation is better. Avarice attends the souls, but if you do what is good and are cautious, surely, Allah is Aware of what you do.
You will not be able to be just between your women, even though you are eager. Do not be altogether partial so that you leave her as if she were suspended. If you reform and are cautious, Allah is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
But if they separate, Allah will enrich each of them out from His Vastness. He is the Embracer, the Wise.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth. We have charged those who were given the Book before you and you to fear Allah. If you disbelieve, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is Rich, the Praised.
To Allah belongs all that is in heaven and earth. It is sufficient that Allah is a Guardian.
O people, if He will, He could make you extinct, and bring others. Surely, Allah is Powerful over that.
Whosoever desires the reward of the world, with Allah is the reward of the world and of the Everlasting Life. Allah is the Hearer, the Seer.
Believers, be maintainers of justice and witnesses for Allah, even though it is against yourselves, your parents, or your kinsmen, whether he is rich or poor, Allah has more rights over both of them. So do not follow desires, so that you are (not) just. If you twist or turn, Allah is Aware of what you do.
Believers, believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), in the Book He has sent down to His Messenger, and in the Book He sent down before. Whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, has surely gone astray into far error.
Those who believe, and then disbelieve, and then believe, and then disbelieve, and increase in disbelief Allah is not to forgive them nor guide them on a way.
Give glad tidings to the hypocrites that for them there is a painful punishment.
Those who take unbelievers for guides instead of believers, are they seeking might with them? Surely, the Might altogether belongs to Allah.
He has sent down upon you in the Book: "When you hear His verses being disbelieved or mocked, do not sit with them until they engage in other talk, or elseyou will surely be like them. Allah will surely gather the hypocrites and unbelievers altogether in Gehenna (Hell).
(As for) those who lay in wait for you. If a victory comes to you from Allah they say: 'Were we not with you' But if the unbelievers get a portion, they say, 'Were we not mightier than you, and did we not defend you from the believers' Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. Allah will not grant the unbelievers any way over the believers.
The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but Allah is deceiving them. When they stand up to pray, they stand up lazily, showing off to the people and do not remember Allah, except a little,
wavering between (belief and disbelief), neither to these nor to those, and whom Allah leads astray, you will not find a way for him.
Believers, do not take the unbelievers for guides instead of the believers, or do you desire to give Allah a clear authority over you?
The hypocrites will be in the lowest place of the Fire, you will not find a helper for them.
But those who repent and mend (their ways), who hold fast to Allah, and make their religion sincerely for Allah they are with the believers, and Allah will certainly give the believers a great wage.
What, would Allah do with punishing you if you thank and believe! Allah is the Thanker, the Knower.
Allah does not love the shouting of evil words, except by he who has been wronged. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
If you display good or hide it, or pardon an evil, surely, Allah is the Pardoner, the Powerful.
Those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers, and desire to divide between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Him without them), and say, 'We believe in some (Prophets Moses and Jesus), and disbelieve in some of them (such as Prophet Muhammad)' desiring to take between this (and that) a way (between belief and disbelief)
those in truth are the unbelievers, and We have prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who believe in Allah, and His Messengers and do not divide between any of them; to those, We shall surely give them their wages. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
The People of the Book ask you to bring down upon them a Book from heaven. Of Moses they asked greater than that, they said to him: 'Show us Allah openly' And a thunderbolt took them for their evil doing. Then they took to themselves the calf, after the clear proofs had come to them, yet We forgave that and We gave Moses clear authority.
And We raised the Mount above them, and took covenant with them, and We said: 'Enter in at the gate, prostrating', and We said to them, 'Do not transgress the Sabbath', and We took from them a solemn covenant.
So, for their breaking of the covenant, and disbelieving the verses of Allah, and killing their Prophets without right and for saying, 'Our hearts are covered' no, but Allah has sealed them for their disbelief, so, except for a few, they do not believe.
Also for their disbelief and their saying about Mary a great calumny,
and for their saying, 'We killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger (and Prophet) of Allah' They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but to them, he (the crucified) had been given the look (of Prophet Jesus). Those who differ concerning him (Prophet Jesus) are surely in doubt regarding him, they have no knowledge of him, except the following of supposition, and (it is) a certainty they did not kill him.
Rather, Allah raised him up to Him. Allah is Almighty, the Wise.
There is not one of the People of the Book but will surely believe in him (Prophet Jesus) before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.
And for the harmdoing of those of Jewry, We have forbidden them the good things that were permitted to them, and also for their barring many from the way of Allah.
And for their taking of usury, that they were prohibited, and consuming the wealth of people in falsehood, for the unbelievers among them We have prepared a painful punishment.
But those of them that are firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers believing in what has been sent down to you (Prophet Muhammad), and what was sent down before you, and those who establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day to those, We surely give a great wage.
We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and to the Prophets after him, and We revealed to (Prophets) Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the tribes, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and We gave to David the Psalms.
And Messengers of whom We have narrated to you before, and Messengers of whom We did not narrate to you. Certainly, Allah talked to Moses.
Messengers bearing glad tidings and warning, so that the people will have no argument against Allah, after the Messengers. Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
But Allah bears witness for that which He has sent down to you. He has sent it down with His Knowledge, and the angels bear witness, it is sufficient that Allah is the Witness.
Those who disbelieve and bar from the way of Allah have strayed into far error.
Surely, those who disbelieve and have done harm. Allah would not forgive them, neither guide them to a Path,
except the road to Gehenna, there they are eternal, and for Allah that is an easy matter.
O people, the Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe, it is better for you. If you disbelieve, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
People of the Book, do not exaggerate your religion. Do not say about Allah except the truth. Indeed, the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, is only a Messenger (and Prophet) of Allah, and His Word (Be) which He gave to Mary, and a (created) spirit by Him. So believe in Allah and His Messengers and do not say: 'Trinity. 'Refrain, it is better for you. Allah is only One God. Exaltations to Him that He should have son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, it is sufficient that Allah is the Guardian.
The Messiah would not despise being a worshiper of Allah, nor would the angels who are near. Whosoever despises worshipping Him, and becomes proud, He will surely assemble them all to Him.
As for those who believe and did good deeds, He will pay them in full their wages, and He will increase them from His Bounty. As for those who despise and became proud, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will find neither a guide nor a helper for themselves, other than Allah.
O people, a proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.
Those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will surely admit them to a Mercy and Bounty from Him, and He will guide them to Him on a Straight Path.
They will ask you for a verdict. Say: 'Allah rules for you concerning the indirect heir (alkalalah which is), if a person dies, having no children, but he has a sister, she shall receive half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she has no children. If there are two sisters, they shall receive twothirds of what he leaves, if there are siblings, men and women, for a male like the share of two females. Allah clarifies to you, lest you go astray, Allah is Knowledgeable of everything.
