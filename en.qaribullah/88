Have you received the news of the Enveloper?
On that Day faces shall be humbled,
laboring, wornout,
roasting at a scorching Fire
that is fueled from a tremendously hot fountain,
no food for them except thorny plants
which neither sustains, nor satisfy hunger.
(Whereas other) faces on that Day will be joyful,
well pleased with their striving,
in a Garden on high,
where they will hear no idle talk.
A gushing fountain shall be there
and raised couches,
and prepared goblets,
and arranged cushions
and outspread carpets.
What, do they not reflect upon how the camel was created?
And how the heaven was raised up,
and how the mountains were firmly fixed?
And how the earth was outstretched?
Therefore remind, you are only a Reminder.
You are not charged to oversee them.
As for those who turn their back and disbelieve,
Allah will punish them with the greatest punishment.
Indeed, to Us they shall return,
then upon Us shall rest their reckoning.
