We sent this (the Holy Koran) down on the Night of Honor.
What could let you know what the Night of Honor is!
The Night of Honor is better than a thousand months,
in it the angels and the Spirit (Gabriel) descend by the permission of their Lord upon every command.
Peace it is, till the break of dawn.
