By the fig and the olive!
and the Mount, Sinai,
and this safe country (Mecca)!
Indeed, We created the human with the fairest stature
and We shall return him to the lowest of the low,
except the believers who do good works, for theirs shall be an unfailing recompense.
So, what then shall belie you concerning the Recompense?
Is Allah not the Most Just of judges!
