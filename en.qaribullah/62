All that is in heavens and earth exalt Allah, the King, the Pure, the Almighty, the Wise.
It is He who has raised among the illiterate (Arabs), a Messenger from themselves, to recite to them His verses, to purify them, and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom, though before that they were in clear error,
together with others who have not as yet joined them. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
Such is the Favor of Allah; He gives it to whom He will, and Allah is of abounding favors.
The likeness of those who were loaded with the Torah, but did not carry it, is like that of a donkey carrying books. Evil is the example of the people who have belied the verses of Allah. Allah does not guide the evildoers.
Say: 'O you who are Jews, if you claim that of all people, you alone are the guided by Allah, then long for death if you are truthful'
But, because of what their hands forwarded they will never long for it. Allah knows the harmdoers.
Say: 'Death from which you flee is sure to reach you. Then you shall be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, and He will tell you all that you have done'
Believers, when you are called to prayer on the Day of the Congregation (Friday), hasten to the Remembrance of Allah and put your trading to oneside. That is the best for you, if you but knew.
Then, when the prayer has ended, disperse in the land and seek the favor of Allah, and, remember Allah often, so that you prosper.
Yet when they see some commerce or amusement they flock to it, leaving you standing. Say: 'That which is with Allah is better than the amusement and commerce. Allah is the Best of Providers'
