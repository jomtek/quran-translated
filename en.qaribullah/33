O Prophet, fear Allah, and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, for Allah is Aware of what they do,
put your trust in Allah; Allah suffices as a Guardian.
Allah has never made any man with two hearts inside him. Nor has He made your wives, when you divorce, saying: 'Be as my mother's back' your mothers. Neither has He made your fostered sons as your own sons. These are your own sayings, words which you utter with your mouths; but Allah speaks the truth and guides to the Path.
Name them after their fathers, that is more just with Allah. If you do not know their fathers, regard them as your brothers in the religion, or those under your sponsorship. There is no fault in you if you make mistakes, but only in what your hearts intended. Allah is Forgiving and the Most Merciful,
The Prophet has a greater right on the believers than their own selves, his wives are their mothers. Kinsmen are closer to one another in the Book of Allah than to other believers and the emigrants; although you should act honorably towards those you sponsor, that is written in the Book
We took from the Prophets their covenant and from you (Prophet Muhammad), from Noah and Abraham, from Moses and Jesus the son of Mary. We took a solemn covenant from them,
so that Allah might question the truthful about their truthfulness. But for the unbelievers He has prepared a painful punishment.
Believers, remember the Favor of Allah to you when there came against you hosts (armies). We unleashed against them a wind and hosts (angels) you could not see. Allah sees the things you do.
They came on you from above and from below, and when your eyes swerved and your hearts leapt to your throats, and you thought thoughts about Allah;
there the believers were tried, they were shaken, a severe quake.
The hypocrites and those in whose hearts there is a disease said: 'Allah and His Messenger promised nothing but delusion'
And when a party of them said: 'People of Yathrib (Madinah), there is no place for you here, therefore return' And a party of them asked leave of theProphet, saying: 'Our houses are exposed' whereas they were not, they only wished to flee.
And if an entrance had been forced against them from its quarters, and then they had been asked to incite, they would have done so, and remained in it (the city) but a little (time).
Yet before that, they made a covenant with Allah never to turn their backs. And covenants with Allah shall be questioned.
Say: 'Flight will not avail you, if you flee from death or slaughter, you would enjoy (this world) only for a little (time)'
Say: 'Who can defend you from Allah if He desires harm for you, or if He desires mercy for you' They shall find for themselves none, other than Allah, to protect or help them.
Allah knows those of you who hinder, and those who say to their brothers: 'Come to us' and they do not come to the battle but a little,
being mean towards you. When fear comes to them, you see them looking at you, their eyes rolling as though they were on the point of death. But once the fear departs they assail you with their sharp tongues, being greedy to possess good things. Those have never believed; Allah has annulled their deeds. That is easy for Allah.
They think the confederates have not departed. Indeed, if the confederates should come again they would sooner be in the desert among the Bedouins asking news of you. If they were among you, they would fight but a little.
In the Messenger of Allah you have a fine example for he who hopes for Allah and the Last Day and remembers Allah abundantly.
When the believers saw the confederates they said: 'This is what Allah and His Messenger have promised us. Surely, Allah and His Messenger have spoken in truth' And this did not increase them except in belief and submission.
Among the believers there are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah. Some have fulfilled their vow dying, and others await, unyielding tochange,
so that Allah will recompense the truthful for their truthfulness and punish the hypocrites if He will, or turn again to them. Surely, Allah is the Forgiver and the Most Merciful.
Allah sent back the unbelievers in their rage, and they gained no good. Allah spared the believers from fighting, surely Allah is the Strong, the Mighty.
He brought down from their fortresses those who had supported them from among the People of the (Jewish) Book and cast terror into their hearts, so that some you killed and others you took captive.
He made you inheritors of their land, their houses, and their possessions, and another land on which you had never set foot before. Truly, Allah is Powerful over everything.
O Prophet, say to your wives: 'If you seek this life and its finery, come, I will release you with a fine release.
But if you seek Allah and His Messenger and the Everlasting Residence, know that Allah has prepared for those of you who do good works a mighty wage'
O wives of the Prophet! Whosoever among you commit a flagrant indecency, for her the punishment shall be doubled, that is easy for Allah.
But she who obeys Allah and His Messenger and does good works shall be doubly recompensed; for her We have made a generous provision.
O wives of the Prophet, you are not like other women. If you fear (Allah), do not be to complaisant in your speech, lest he in whose heart there is a sickness may desire (of his mother); but speak honorable words.
Stay in your homes and do not display your finery as pagan women used to do in the olden Days of Ignorance. Establish your prayers, pay the obligatory charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. O family of the House, Allah only wishes to distance fault from you, and to cleanse you, and to purify you abundantly.
And remember that which is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and the Wisdom. Allah is the Subtle, the Knower.
For men and women who have surrendered believing men and women; obedient men and women; truthful men and women, patient men and women, humble men and women, men and women who give charity, men and women who fast, men and women who guard their privates, men and women who remember Allah in abundance, for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a mighty wage.
It is not for any believer man or woman to have the choice in the affair when a matter is decreed by Allah and His Prophet. Whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger strays into clear error.
And when you said to he whom Allah had favored and yourself have favored: 'Keep your wife and fear Allah' and you sought to hide in yourself what Allah was to reveal, fearing people; although Allah has a better right for you to fear Him. And when Zayd had accomplished what he would of her (divorce), We gave her to you (Prophet Muhammad) in marriage, so that there is no fault in believers concerning (marriage to) the former spouse of their foster children if they divorced them. The decree of Allah must be done.
No fault shall be attached to the Prophet for doing what Allah has obligated for him. Such was the way of Allah with those who passed away before the decree of Allah is a decree determined
who were delivering the Messages of Allah, fearing Him and fearing none except Allah. Allah suffices as a Reckoner.
Muhammad is not the father of any of your men. He is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets. Allah has knowledge of all things.
Believers, remember Allah frequently,
exalt Him at dawn and in the evening.
It is He who has mercy on you, and His angels to bring you out from the darkness into light. He is the Most Merciful to the believers.
On the Day they meet Him, their greeting shall be 'Peace' A generous recompense He has prepared for them.
O Prophet, We have sent you as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings, and to bear warning;
a caller to Allah by His permission and as a light shedding lamp.
Give to the believers the glad tidings that with Allah there is for them a great bounty.
Do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites, pay no attention to their hurt. Put your trust in Allah; Allah suffices as a Guardian.
Believers, if you marry believing women and divorce them before the marriage is consummated, you have no period to count against them. Provide for them and release them kindly.
O Prophet, We have made lawful to you the wives to whom you have given dowries and those whom your right hand possesses, of whatever spoils of war that Allah has given you; and the daughters of your paternal uncles and paternal aunts, and of your paternal and maternal aunts who migrated with you; and any believing woman who gives herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet wishes to take her in marriage. This is only for you and not any other believer. We know the duties We have imposed on them concerning their wives and those whom their right hand possesses, so that there should be no fault in you. Allah is the Forgiving and Merciful.
You may defer any of them (your wives) if you please and invite any of them if you please. If you seek any you have put aside there is no fault in you. So that it is likelier they will be comforted, and not sorrow, and every one of them will be pleased, and all are pleased with what you give them. Allah knows what is in your hearts. Allah is the Knower, the Clement.
It shall be unlawful for you to take more wives or to exchange your present wives for other women, though their beauty pleases you, except those whom your right hand possesses. Allah is watchful over everything.
Believers, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without waiting for the proper time, unless you are given permission. But if you are invited, enter, and when you have eaten, disperse, not desiring conversation, for that is hurtful to the Prophet and he would be shy before you; but of the truth Allah is not shy. And when you ask his wives for anything, speak to them from behind a curtain, that is cleaner for your hearts and theirs. You must not hurt the Messenger of Allah, nor shall you ever wed his wives after him, surely, this would be a monstrous thing with Allah.
Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, Allah has knowledge of all things.
It shall be no offense for them (to be seen unveiled) by their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, and those whom their right hands possess. And fear Allah, for Allah is witness of everything.
Allah and His angels praise and venerate the Prophet. Believers, praise and venerate him and pronounce peace upon him in abundance.
Those who (try to) hurt Allah and His Messenger shall be cursed by Allah in this present life and in the Everlasting Life, and He has prepared for them a humbling punishment.
Those who hurt believing men and believing women undeservedly, shall bear the guilt of slander and a major sin.
O Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters and the believing women to draw their veils close to them, so it is likelier they will be known, and not hurt. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
If the hypocrites and those who have a disease in their hearts, and those who make a commotion in the City do not desist, We will surely urge you against them. Then they will be your neighbors for only a little (while),
cursed wherever they are found, they will be seized and put to death.
Such has been the way of Allah with those who have passed before them, and you shall find no change in the ways of Allah.
The people will ask you about the Hour. Say: 'The knowledge of it is with Allah alone, what makes you to know that the Hour is near'
Allah has cursed the unbelievers and prepared for them a Blaze.
Living there for ever, they shall neither find a guardian nor a helper.
On that Day when their faces are turned about in the Fire, they shall say: 'Would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger'
And they shall say: 'Our Lord, We obeyed our masters and our eminent ones, but they misled us from the way.
Our Lord, let their punishment be doubled; and curse them with a mighty curse'
Believers, do not be like those who hurt Moses. Allah cleared him of what they said. His face is honorable with Allah.
O you who believe, fear Allah and say sound statements,
and He will mend your deeds for you and forgive your sins. Whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger shall win a great victory.
We offered the trust to the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains, but they refused to bear it, and were afraid of it, and the human carried it. Surely, he is a harmdoer, and ignorant.
Allah punishes the hypocrites, men and women alike, and the idolaters, both men and women alike; and Allah turns to the believers, men and women alike. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
