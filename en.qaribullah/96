Read (Prophet Muhammad) in the Name of your Lord who created,
created the human from a (blood) clot.
Read! Your Lord is the Most Generous,
who taught by the pen,
taught the human what he did not know.
Indeed, surely the human is very insolent
that he sees himself sufficed.
Indeed, to your Lord is the returning.
What do you think? Have you seen he who forbids
a worshiper when he prays.
Have you seen if he was upon guidance
or orders piety?
What do you think? Have you seen if he belies and turns away,
does he not know that Allah sees?
Indeed, if he does not desist, We will seize him by the forelock,
a lying, sinful forelock.
So, let him call upon his way!
We, will call the Zabania (the harsh angels of Hell).
No, indeed; do not obey him! Prostrate and come nearer (to Allah).
