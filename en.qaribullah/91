By the sun and its midmorning,
by the moon, which follows it,
by the day, when it displays it,
by the night, when it envelops it!
By the heaven and Who built it,
by the earth and Who spread it,
by the soul and Who shaped it
and inspired it with its sin and its piety,
prosperous is he who purified it,
and failed is he who buried it!
Thamood belied in their pride
when the most wicked of them broke forth,
the Messenger of Allah said to them: '(This is) the shecamel of Allah, let her drink'
But they belied him, and hamstrung her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin and leveled it (their village).
He does not fear the result (of their destruction).
