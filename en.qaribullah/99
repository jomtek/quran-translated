When the earth is shaken with its mighty shaking,
and when the earth brings forth its burdens
and the human asks: "What is the matter with it?"
On that Day it shall proclaim its news,
for your Lord will have revealed to it.
On that Day mankind shall issue in scatterings to see their deeds.
Whosoever has done an atom's weight of good shall see it,
and whosoever has done an atom's weight of evil shall see it.
