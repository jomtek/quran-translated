Praise belongs for Allah, the Originator of the heavens and earth, who appointed the angels to be Messengers, with wings, two, three, and four. He increases the creation as He wills. Allah has power over all things.
Whatever mercy Allah opens to people, none can withhold; and whatever He withholds none can release after Him. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
People, remember the blessings of Allah to you. Except for Allah, is there any other creator who provides for you out of heaven and earth? There is no god except He. Where then do you turn?
If they belie you, other Messengers have been belied before you. To Allah all matters are returned.
People, the promise of Allah is true, so do not let this present life delude you, and do not let the deluder (satan) delude you about Allah.
satan is indeed your enemy; therefore take him for an enemy. He calls his party so that they will become the companions of the Blaze.
For the unbelievers awaits a terrible punishment, but for those who believe and do good deeds is forgiveness and a great recompense.
What then of he whose evil deeds have been decorated fair to him and thinks them to be good? Allah leads astray whomsoever He will and whomsoever He will He guides. Do not let your soul be wasted in regrets for them; Allah has knowledge of all they do.
Allah is He who sends the winds that stir up the clouds. Then, We drive them on to a dead land and revive the earth after it's death. Such is the Raising Up.
He who wants might, the Might belongs to Allah altogether. To Him ascend good words, and the righteous deed He raises. But those who devise evil deeds theirs shall be a terrible punishment, and their plotting shall be annulled.
Allah created you from dust, then from a (sperm) drop. Then he made you pairs. No female conceives or is delivered except by His Knowledge. He whose life is long, whatsoever is increased or decreased of his age is in a Clear Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.
The two seas are not alike. One is fresh, sweet and pleasant to taste, while the other is salt and bitter. Yet, from each you eat fresh flesh and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear. And you see the ships plow their course through it so that you may seek His bounty, and in order that you give thanks.
He causes the night to enter into the day and the day into the night. He has subjected the sun and the moon each running for a named term. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the Kingdom; and those whom you call upon, other than Him, do not possess even as much as the membrane of a datestone.
If you supplicate to them they cannot hear your supplication, and if they heard, they cannot answer you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown your associating. None can tell you like He who is the Aware.
People, it is you who are in need of Allah. He is the Rich, the Praised.
He can put you away, if He will, and bring a new creation
this is not a great matter for Allah.
No laden soul shall bear another's load. If one is heavyburdened and calls for his load to be carried, nothing of it will be carried, not even if he is a close relative. You warn only those who fear their Lord in the Unseen, and establish the prayer. He who purifies himself, purifies himself for the good of his own soul. To Allah is the arrival.
The blind and the seeing are not equal,
nor are darkness and light.
The shade and the hot wind are not equal,
nor are the living and the dead equal. Allah makes to hear whosoever He will, but you cannot make those who are in their graves hear.
You (Prophet Muhammad) are but a warner.
We have sent you with the truth, a bearer of glad tidings and warning, for there is no nation, that has not had a warner pass away in it.
If they belie you, those before them also belied. Their Messengers came to them with clear signs; the Psalms, and the Illuminating Book.
Then I seized those who disbelieved, and how was My rejection!
Did you not see how Allah sends down water from the sky and with it brings forth different colored fruits? In the mountains there are paths of various colors, of white and red, and jetblack.
People too, and beasts and cattle have their different colors. But it is only those amongst His worshippers that fear Allah who have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is the Almighty and the Forgiving.
Indeed, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish their prayers and spend, in secret and in public of that which We have provided them, look for a trade that does not come to nothing,
so that He may pay them in full their wages and enrich them from His bounty. Surely, He is the Forgiver and the Thanker.
That which We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth and it confirms what was before it. Allah is Aware and sees His worshipers.
Then, We gave the Book as an inheritance to those of our worshipers whom We chose. Among them, is he who was harmful to himself, and some who minimize, and some who, by the permission of Allah, race in charity, this is the greatest virtue.
They shall enter the Gardens of Eden, where they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and there, their robes shall be of silk.
They shall say: 'Praise belongs to Allah who has removed all sorrow from us. Indeed, our Lord is the Forgiver, the Thanker.
Through His bounty He has made us to live in the abode of Everlasting Life, where neither weariness nor fatigue shall touch us'
As for the unbelievers, theirs is the Fire of Gehenna. They shall neither be done away with nor die, and its punishment shall never be lightened for them. As such shall We recompense every unbeliever.
There they will cry out: 'Our Lord, bring us out, and we will do good, other than what we have done' What, did We not make your lives long enough to remember for whosoever would remember? A warner came to you, so taste now! None shall help the harmdoers.
Allah knows the Unseen in the heavens and earth. He knows that which is in the innermost of the chests.
It is He who made you caliphs in the earth. He who disbelieves, his disbelief shall be charged against him. The unbelievers disbelief does nothing for them, except, increase them in hate with Allah their disbelief increases the unbelievers only in loss.
Say: 'Have you considered your associates who you call upon, other than Allah? Show me what they have created in the earth! Or, have they a partnership in the heavens' Or, have We given them a Book so that they have proof of it? No, the harmdoers promise each other nothing else but delusion.
It is Allah who holds the heavens and the earth lest they vanish. Should they vanish, none would hold them after Him. He is the Clement, the Forgiving.
They solemnly swore by Allah that if a warner came to them they would be more rightly guided than any other of the nations. Yet, when a warner came to them, it only increased their aversion,
behaving arrogantly in the land and devising evil. But, evil devising coils only those who do it. Do they look except for the ways of former nations? You shall never find any change in the way of Allah.
What, have they not journeyed through the land and seen the end of those who went before them? They were stronger and mightier than themselves. Allah! There is nothing in heavens or earth that can frustrate Him, He is the Knower, the Able.
If Allah should take people to task for what they have earned, He would not leave one creature that crawls upon the face (of the earth)! But, He is deferring them to a named time. And when their time comes, indeed, Allah is the Seer of His worshipers.
