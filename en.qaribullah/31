AlifLaamMeem.
Those are the verses of the Wise Book,
a guidance and a mercy to those who do good,
who establish the prayer, pay the obligatory charity, and firmly believe in the Everlasting Life.
Those are guided by their Lord and will surely prosper.
There are some people who would purchase distracting talk, to lead astray from the Path of Allah without knowledge, and take it in mockery; for those is a humiliating punishment.
When Our verses are recited to him, he turns his back in pride, as though he never heard them, and in his ears was heaviness. Give glad tidings to him of a painful punishment!
But for those who believe and do good works are Gardens of Bliss,
where they shall live for ever. The promise of Allah is the truth; He is the Almighty, the Wise.
He created the heavens without pillars that you see and cast on the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with you. Upon it He dispersed all manner of crawling thing, and He sent down water from the sky with which He caused to grow in it every generous kind.
Such is the creation of Allah; now show me what, other than Him, created! No, the harmdoers are in clear error.
We gave wisdom to Lokman (saying): 'Give thanks to Allah. He who gives thanks, thanks only for himself, but whosoever is ungrateful, surely, Allah is the Rich, the Praised'
And when Lokman said to his son, in warning: 'My son, associate none with Allah, to associate others with Allah is a tremendous wrong'
And We charged the human concerning his parents, for his mother bore him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning was in two years. Be thankful to Me and to your parents, to Me is the arrival.
But if they strive with you to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. And accompany them in this life with kindness; and follow the Path of he who turned to Me. To Me you shall return and I will inform you of all that you have done.
(Lokman said:) 'My son, if it should be but the weight of one grain of mustardseed, and though it be on a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah shall bring it. Surely, Allah is the Subtle, Aware.
My son, establish the prayer, order with honor but forbid dishonor, and bear patiently with whatever may fall upon you, indeed that is true constancy.
Do not turn your cheek in scorn away from people, nor walk proudly on the earth; Allah does not love the proud and the boastful.
Walk modestly, and lower your voice; the most hideous of voices is the braying of the donkey.
Do you not see how Allah has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and the earth, and lavished on you His visible and unseen favors? Yet some people would argue about Allah without knowledge, or guidance, or an Illuminating Book'
When it is said to them: 'Follow what Allah has sent down' they reply: 'No, rather we will follow that which we found our fathers upon' What! Even though satan is inviting them to the punishment of the Fire!
He who surrenders himself to Allah and is a good doer, has grasped the firmest handle. To Allah the issue of affairs return.
As for those who disbelieve, do not let their disbelief grieve you, to Us they shall return and We will tell to them what they did. Allah has knowledge of what is innermost in their chests.
We give to them a little enjoyment for awhile, and then will compel them to a tremendous punishment.
If you ask them: 'Who has created the heavens and the earth' They will reply: 'Allah' Say: 'Praise belongs to Allah' But most of them do not have knowledge.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He is the Rich, the Praised.
If all the trees in the earth were pens, and the sea, with seven more seas to replenish it (with ink), the Words of Allah would never end. Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
Your creation and your resurrection are but as a single soul. Allah is the Hearer, the Seer.
Do you not see how Allah causes the night to enter into the day, and the day enter into the night and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running to a named term? Allah is Aware of what you do.
For Allah is the Truth, while that which they call upon, other than Him, is false. For that Allah is the Most High, the Great.
Do you not see how the ships run upon the sea, by the Favor of Allah so that He may show you His signs? Surely, there are signs in this for every steadfast, thankful person.
When the waves, like shadows, envelop them, they call to Allah making their religion sincerely His, but no sooner does He bring them safely to land then some of them are halfhearted. None denies Our verses, except the ungrateful traitor.
People, fear your Lord, and fear the Day when no father shall ransom a thing for his child nor a child for his father. The promise of Allah is surely true. So do not let the life of this present world delude you, nor let the deluder (satan) delude you concerning Allah.
Allah, He alone has knowledge of the Hour. He sends down the rain and He knows what is in the wombs. No soul knows what he will earn tomorrow; and no soul knows in what land it will die. Surely, Allah is the Knower, the Aware.
