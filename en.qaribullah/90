No, I swear by this country (Mecca),
and you are a lodger in this country.
And by the giver of birth, and whom he fathered,
We created the human in fatigue.
Does he think that none has power over him!
He will say: 'I have destroyed a vast wealth'
Does he think that none has observed him?
Have We not given him two eyes,
a tongue, and two lips,
and guided him on the two paths (of good and evil)?
Yet he has not scaled the height.
What could let you know what the height is!
(It is) the freeing of a slave,
the giving of food upon the day of hunger
to an orphaned relative
or to a needy person in distress;
so that he becomes one of those who believe, charge each other to be patient, and charge each other to be merciful.
Those are the Companions of the Right.
But those who disbelieve in Our verses, they are the Companions of the Left,
with the Fire closed above them.
