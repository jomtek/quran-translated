By the sky, and by the nightly comer!
What could let you know what the nightly comer is!
(It is) the piercing star.
For every soul there is a watcher.
Let the human reflect of what he is created.
He was created from ejaculated water
that issues from between the loins and the ribs.
Surely, He is Able to bring him back,
on the Day when consciences are examined,
when he will be helpless, with no supporter.
By the sky with its returning rain,
and by the earth bursting with vegetation;
this is indeed a Decisive Word,
it is not a jest.
They are cunningly devising,
and I am cunningly devising.
Therefore respite the unbelievers, and delay them for a while.
