He frowned and turned away
when the blind came to him.
And what could let you know? Perhaps he (comes to hear you) to be purified.
(He might) remember, and the Reminder might profit him.
As for he who is sufficed
you attended to him,
although it is not for you to be concerned if he remained unpurified.
And to him who came to you eagerly
and fearfully,
of him you were unmindful.
No indeed, this is a Reminder;
and whosoever wills, shall remember it.
upon highly honored pages,
exalted, purified,
by the hands of scribes
noble and pious.
Perish the human! How unthankful he is!
From what did He create him?
From a (sperm) drop He created him and then determined him,
then eased his path for him,
then causes him to die and buries him,
then, He will raise him when He wills.
Indeed, he has not fulfilled that which He has ordered him.
Let the human reflect on the food he eats,
how We pour down rain in abundance,
and split the earth, splitting,
how We made the grain to grow,
grapes, and fresh fodder,
and the olive, and the palm,
the densely tree'd gardens,
and fruit and pastures,
for you and for your herds to delight in.
But, when the Blast comes,
on that Day each person will flee from his brother,
his mother and his father,
his wife and his children.
Everyone on that Day will have affairs to keep him occupied.
Some faces will shine,
laughing and joyful,
whereas some faces will be covered with dust
and veiled with darkness.
Those, they are the unbelievers, the immoral.
