In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Most Merciful
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,
the Merciful, the Most Merciful,
Owner of the Day of Recompense.
You (alone) we worship; and You (alone) we rely for help.
Guide us to the Straight Path,
the Path of those upon whom You have favored, not those upon whom is the anger, nor the astray. (Amen please answer)
