The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the idolaters would never desist until the Clear Proof came to them.
A Messenger from Allah reciting Purified Pages
in which there are valuable Books.
Those to whom the Book was given did not divide themselves until the Clear Proof came to them.
Yet they were ordered to worship Allah alone, making the Religion His sincerely, upright, and to establish their prayers and to pay the obligatory charity. That is indeed the Religion of Straightness.
The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the idolaters shall be for ever in the Fire of Gehenna (Hell). They are the worst of all creatures.
But those who believe and do good deeds are the best of all creatures.
Their recompense is with their Lord; Gardens of Eden, underneath which rivers flow, where they shall live for ever. Allah is wellpleased with them, and theyare wellpleased with Him. That is for he who fears his Lord!
