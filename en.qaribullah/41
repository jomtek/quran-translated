HaMeem.
A sending down from the Merciful, the Most Merciful.
A Book, the verses of which are distinguished, an Arabic Koran for a nation who know.
It bears glad tidings and a warning, yet most of them turn away and do not listen.
They say: 'Our hearts are veiled from that to which you call us, and in our ears there is heaviness. And between us and you is a veil. So work (as you will) and we are working'
Say (Prophet Muhammad): 'I am only a human like you, to whom it is revealed that your God is One God. Therefore be straight with Him and ask Him to forgive you. Woe to the idolaters,
who do not pay charity and disbelieve in the Everlasting Life.
For those who believe and do good works is an enduring wage'
Say: 'Do you disbelieve in Him who created the earth in two days? And do you set up equals with Him? He is the Lord of the Worlds'
He set firm mountains on top (of the earth) and He blessed it. And in four days He ordained in it many provisions, equal to those who ask.
Then He willed to the heaven when it was smoke, and to it and the earth He said: 'Come willingly, or unwillingly' 'We come willingly' they answered.
In two days He determined them seven heavens, and He revealed to each heaven its commands. We decorated the lowest heaven with lamps and preserve them. Such is the decree of the Almighty, the Knower.
But if they turn away, say: 'I have given you warning of a thunderbolt similar to that which overtook Aad and Thamood'
When their Messengers came to them from before them and behind them, (saying): 'Worship none except Allah' they answered: 'Had it been the will of our Lord, He would have sent down angels. So we disbelieve in the Message with which you were sent'
As for Aad, they behaved proudly in the earth without right. 'Who is stronger than us' they would say. Could they not see that Allah, who created them, is stronger than they? But they disbelieved Our signs.
Then, on the ominous days, We loosed against them a howling wind that We might let them taste the punishment of humiliation in this life; but more humiliating will be the punishment of the Everlasting Life and they will not be helped.
As for Thamood, We (offered) them Our Guidance, but they preferred blindness to guidance. So a thunderbolt of the humiliating punishment seized them because of what they had earned;
and We saved those who believed and feared Allah.
On the Day when the enemies of Allah will be rightfully gathered together before Fire,
when they reach it, their hearing, eyes and skins will testify against them for what they were doing.
'Why did you bear witness against us' they will ask their skins, and they will reply: 'Allah has given us speech, as He has given speech to everything. It was He who created you the first time, and to Him you shall return.
It is not that you covered yourselves so that your hearing, eyes and skin could not bear witness against you but you thought that Allah did not know much of that which you do.
Rather, it is the thoughts you thought about your Lord that have destroyed you, therefore, this morning you find yourselves among the losers'
Even if they are patient the Fire shall still be their lodging, and if they seek pardon, they shall not be among those who are pardoned.
We have assigned companions to them, who make what is before them and behind them seem fair to them. The statement has been realized against them in nations of people and jinn alike that passed away before them they were indeed the losers.
The unbelievers say: 'Do not listen to this Koran, and talk idly about it so that you might be overcome'
We will let the unbelievers taste a terrible punishment, and recompense them with the worst of what they were doing.
The Fire that is the recompense of the enemies of Allah. There it is that they will be lodged for eternity, a recompense for their disbelief of Our verses.
The unbelievers will say: 'Lord, show us the jinn and people who led us astray, to put them under our feet so that they are among the lowest'
The angels will descend on those who said: 'Allah is Our Lord' and have then gone straight, (saying:) 'Be neither fearful, nor sad; rejoice in the Paradise you have been promised.
We are your guides in this world and in the Everlasting Life. There, you shall have all that your souls desire, and all that you ask for
as hospitality from One, the Forgiving, the Most Merciful'
And, who is better in saying than he who invites to Allah, does what is right, and says: 'Surely, I am of those who surrender'
Good and evil deeds are not equal. Repel with that which is most just, and see, the one whom there is enmity between you will be as if he were a loyal guide.
But none will receive it except those who are patient and, none shall receive it, except he who has a great share.
If a provocation from satan should provoke you, seek refuge in Allah. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
Among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. But do not prostrate yourselves before the sun or the moon; rather prostrate before Allah, who created them both, if it is He whom you worship.
But if they become proud, those who are with your Lord exalt Him by day and night, and never grow weary.
And among His signs is that you see the earth humble; then when He sends down rain upon it, it quivers and swells. He who revives is He who revives the dead, surely, He is powerful over everything.
Those who disbelieve Our verses when it comes to them are not hidden from Us. Is he who is cast in the Fire better than he who comes in safety on the Day of Resurrection? Do as you will, surely, He sees the things you do.
Those who disbelieve in the Remembrance when it comes to them and indeed this is a Mighty Book
falsehood does not come to it from before it or from behind it. It is a sending down from the One, the Wise, the Praised.
Nothing that is said to you has not already been said to other Messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is a Lord of forgiveness, but stern in retribution.
Had We made the Koran in a nonArabic (language) they would have said: 'If only its verses were distinguished! Why in (a) nonArabic (language, when theProphet is) an Arab' Say: 'To the believers it is a guidance and a healing. But to those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears, to them it is blindness. They are those called from afar'
We gave the Book to Moses, but there were disputes about it, and had it not been for a Word that preceded from your Lord (their disputes) would have been decided between them. But they are in disquieting doubt about it.
He who does good does it for himself; and he who does evil does so against it. Your Lord never wrongs His worshipers.
To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit sprouts forth from its sheath, no female conceives or is delivered, except with His Knowledge. On the Day He will call to them: 'Where then are My associates' they will reply: 'We proclaim to You that none of us can bear witness'
Those they used to call upon before will go away from them, and they shall think that they have no asylum.
Mankind never wearies of supplicating for goodness, but when evil befalls him he is downcast and (grows) desperate.
And if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after his affliction has befallen him, he is sure to say: 'This is my own. I do not think the Hour will ever come. And even if I am returned to my Lord, with Him there is for me the finest reward (Paradise)' Then, We shall tell the unbelievers what they did and let them taste a harsh punishment.
When We favor a human, he swerves away and withdraws aside, but when evil befalls him he is full of unending prayer.
Say: 'Think, if this (Koran) is indeed from Allah, and you disbelieve in it, who is further astray than he who is in a wide schism'
We will show them Our signs in all the horizons and in themselves, until it is clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not sufficient that your Lord is witness over everything'
Are they not in doubt concerning the Meeting with their Lord? Attention, He encompasses everything.
