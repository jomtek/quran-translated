By the dawn
and ten nights (of pilgrimage or the last ten days of Ramadan),
by the even, and the odd,
by the night when it journeys on!
Is there in that an oath for the mindful?
Have you not heard how your Lord dealt with Aad?
of the columned (city) of Iram,
the like of which was never created in the countries?
And Thamood, who hewed out the rocks of the valley?
And Pharaoh, of the pegs (impaling his victims)?
They were tyrants in the land
and exceeded in corruption therein.
(Therefore) your Lord let loose upon them a scourge of punishment;
indeed, your Lord is ever watchful.
As for man, when his Lord tests him by honoring him and favoring him, he says: 'My Lord, has honored me'
But when He tests him by restricting his provision, he says: 'My Lord has humiliated me'
No! But you show no good to the orphan,
nor do you urge one another to feed the needy.
and you devour the inheritance with greed,
and you ardently love wealth.
No! But when the earth quakes and is pounded,
and your Lord comes with the angels, rank upon rank,
and Gehenna (Hell) is brought near on that Day the human will remember, and how shall the Reminder be for him?
He will say: 'Would that I had forwarded (good works) for my life!'
But on that Day none will punish as He (Allah) will punish,
nor will any bind as He binds.
O satisfied soul,
return to your Lord wellpleased, wellpleasing.
Join My worshipers and
enter My Paradise!
