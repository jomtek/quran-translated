No! I swear by the Day of Resurrection,
No! I swear by the reproachful soul!
What, does the human think We shall never gather his bones?
Indeed yes, We are able to shape his fingerstips yet again!
Rather, the human desires to continue in his immorality,
'When will the Day of Resurrection be' he asks,
but when the sight is dazed
and the moon eclipsed,
when the sun and moon are gathered together
on that Day the human will ask: 'To (which place) shall I flee'
No, there shall be no (place of) refuge.
For on that Day the refuge shall be to your Lord.
On that Day the human shall be informed of his former and latter deeds.
He shall be a clear proof against himself,
even though he offers his excuses.
Do not move your tongue with it (the Revelation) to hasten it.
It's gathering and reciting is upon Us.
When We recite it, follow its recitation.
It's explanation is upon Us.
Yet you love this hasty world
and are heedless of the Everlasting Life.
On that Day there shall be radiant faces,
gazing towards their Lord.
And on that Day there shall be scowling faces,
so they might think the Calamity had been inflicted upon them.
But, when (the soul) reaches the collar bone
and it is said: 'Who is a healing chanter'
and when he thinks it is the time of departure
and when leg is intertwined with leg,
upon that Day the driving shall be to your Lord.
Because, he neither believed nor prayed;
he belied the truth and turned away;
then went arrogantly to his household.
Near to you and nearer,
then nearer to you and nearer!
Does the human think he will be left to roam at will?
What, was he not an ejaculated drop (of sperm)?
Then he was a clot of blood, then He created and formed him
and made from him two kinds, male and female.
What, is He then unable to revive the dead?
