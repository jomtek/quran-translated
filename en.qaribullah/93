By the midmorning,
and by the night when it covers,
your Lord has not forsaken you (Prophet Muhammad), nor does He hate you.
The Last shall be better for you than the First.
Your Lord will give you, and you will be satisfied.
Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter?
Did He not find you a wanderer so He guided you?
Did He not find you poor and suffice you?
Do not oppress the orphan,
nor drive away the one who asks.
But tell of the favors of your Lord!
