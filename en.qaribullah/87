Exalt the Name of your Lord, the Highest,
who has created and shaped,
who has ordained and guided,
who brings forth the pastures,
then made it dry dark, flaky stubble,
We shall make you recite so that you will not forget,
except what Allah wills, surely, He knows all that is (spoken) aloud and what is hidden.
We shall ease you to the easy.
Therefore remind, if the Reminder benefits,
and he who fears shall remember,
but the most wretched shall avoid it,
who will roast in the Great Fire,
in which he will neither die nor live therein.
Prosperous is he who purifies himself,
and remembers the Name of his Lord, so he prays.
But you prefer the present life,
but the Everlasting Life is better, and more enduring.
Surely, this is in the ancient Scrolls,
the Scrolls of Abraham and Moses.
