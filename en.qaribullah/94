Have We not expanded your chest for you (Prophet Muhammad),
and relieved you of your burden
that weighed down your back?
Have We not raised your remembrance?
Indeed, hardship is followed by ease,
indeed, hardship is followed by ease!
So, when you have finished (your prayer), labor (in supplication),
and let your longing be for your Lord (in humility).
