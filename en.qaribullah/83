Woe to the diminishers,
who, when people measure for them, take full measure,
but when they measure or weigh for others, they reduce!
Do they not think that they will be resurrected
for a great Day,
the Day when people will stand before the Lord of the Worlds?
No indeed, the Book of the immoral is in Sijjeen.
What could let you know what the Sijjeen is!
(It is) a marked Book.
Woe on that Day to those who belied it,
who belied the Day of Recompense!
None belies it except every guilty sinner.
When Our verses are recited to him, he says: 'Fictitious tales of the ancients'
No indeed! Their own deeds have cast a veil over their hearts.
No indeed, on that Day they shall be veiled from their Lord.
Then they shall roast in Hell,
and it will be said to them: 'This is that which you belied'
But, the Book of the righteous is in the 'Illiyoon.
What could let you know what the 'Illiyoon is!
(It is) a marked Book,
witnessed by those who are near (to Allah).
The righteous shall indeed be blissful,
(reclining) upon couches they will gaze,
and in their faces you shall know the radiance of bliss.
They shall be given to drink of a wine that is sealed,
its seal is musk, for this let the competitors compete;
and its mixture is Tasneem,
a fountain at which those brought near (to their Lord) drink.
The sinners laughed at the believers
and winked at one another as they passed them by.
When they returned to their people they returned jesting;
and when they saw them said: 'These are they who are astray'
Yet they were not sent to be their guardians.
But on this Day the believers will laugh at the unbelievers
as they (recline) upon their couches and gaze (around them).
Have the unbelievers been rewarded for what they did?
