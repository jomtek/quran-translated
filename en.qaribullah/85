By the heaven of the constellations!
By the Promised Day!
By the witness and the witnessed!
The companions of the pit were killed
the fire with its fuel,
when they were seated around it
and they were witnesses of what they did to the believers
and their revenge on them was only because they believed in Allah, the Almighty, the Praised,
to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and earth. And Allah is the Witness of all things.
Those who persecuted the believing men and women and never repented, there is for them the punishment of Gehenna (Hell), and for them the punishment of the burning.
(But) for those who believe and do good works, for them there are Gardens underneath which rivers flow that is the Great Victory!
Indeed, the seizing of your Lord is severe.
It is He who originates and repeats.
And He is the Forgiving, and the Loving.
Owner of the Throne, the Exalted.
The Doer of whatever He wants.
Has it come to you the story of the hosts
of Pharaoh and of Thamood?
Yet the unbelievers still belie,
Allah encompasses them all from behind.
Indeed, this is a Glorious Koran,
in a Guarded Tablet.
