What do they question each other about!
About the Great News
whereupon they are at variance?
Indeed, they shall know!
Again, indeed, they shall know!
Have We not made the earth as a cradle
and the mountains as pegs?
And We created you in pairs,
and We made your sleep a rest,
and We made the night a mantle,
and We made the day for a livelihood.
And We built above you seven strong ones,
and placed in them a blazing lamp
and have sent down from the clouds, pouring rain
that We may bring forth with it grain, plants
and luxuriant gardens.
Indeed, the Day of Decision is an appointed time,
the Day that the Horn is blown, and you shall come in crowds
and heaven is opened, having gates,
and the mountains move, and vaporize.
Indeed, Gehenna (Hell) has become an ambush,
a return for the insolent,
there, they shall live for ages,
tasting neither coolness nor any drink
except boiling water and pus
for a suitable recompense.
Indeed, they did not hope for a Reckoning,
and they absolutely belied Our verses,
and everything We have numbered in a Book.
'Taste! We shall not increase you except in punishment'
But, for the cautious a place of prosperity,
and gardens and vineyards,
curvaceous (virgins), of equal age
and an overflowing cup.
There, they shall neither hear idle talk, nor yet any falsehood,
a recompense from your Lord, a gift, a reckoning,
the Lord of the heavens and earth, and all that is between them, the Merciful, of whom they are unable to speak.
On that Day, when the Spirit (Gabriel) and the angels stand in ranks they shall not speak, except he to whom the Merciful has given permission, and sayswhat is right.
That is the Day, the truth, so whosoever wills takes a way to his Lord.
Indeed, We have forewarned you of an imminent punishment, the Day when the person will look upon his works and the unbelievers will say: 'Would that I were dust'
