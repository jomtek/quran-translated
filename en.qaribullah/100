By the snorting runners (the horses),
by the strikers of fire,
by the dawnraiders,
raising a trail of dust,
dividing the gathering.
Indeed, the human is ungrateful to his Lord.
To this he himself shall bear witness.
And indeed he is ardent for the love of good (wealth, becoming greedy).
Does he not know that when that which is in the graves is overthrown,
and that which is in the chest is brought out,
indeed, on that Day their Lord will be aware of them!
