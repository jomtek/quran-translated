When the sun is woundup;
when the stars are thrown down,
and the mountains have been taken,
when the pregnant camels are neglected,
when the savage beasts are gathered
when the seas are set boiling,
when the souls are coupled (to their body),
when the buried female infant is asked
for what crime she was slain,
when the scrolls are unrolled,
when heaven is stripped,
when Hell is set ablaze,
when Paradise is brought near,
then, each soul shall know what it has produced.
Rather, I swear by the returning
orbiting, disappearing;
by the night when it approaches
and the morning when it extends,
it is indeed the word of an Honorable Messenger,
of power, given a rank by the Owner of the Throne
obeyed, and honest.
Your Companion is not mad,
in truth he saw him (Gabriel) on the clear horizon,
he is not grudging of the Unseen.
Nor is this the word of a stoned satan.
Where then are you going?
This is nothing but a Reminder to the worlds,
for whosoever of you would go straight,
but you shall not, unless Allah wills, the Lord of all the Worlds.
