The Clatterer (the Day of Judgement)!
What is the Clatterer.
What shall let you know what the Clatterer is!
On that Day people shall become like scattered moths
and the mountains like tufts of carded wool.
Then he whose deeds weigh heavy in the Scale
shall live in a life which is pleasing,
but he whose weight is light in the Scale,
his head will be in the Plunging
What shall let you know what the Plunging is?
(It is) a Fire which is extremely hot.
