The excessive gathering (of increase and boasting) occupied you (from worshipping and obeying)
until you visit the graves.
But no, indeed, you shall soon know.
Again, no indeed, you shall soon know.
Indeed, did you know with certain knowledge
that you shall surely see Hell?
Again, you shall surely see it with the sight of certainty.
On that Day, you shall be questioned about the pleasures.
