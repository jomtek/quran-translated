Woe to every backbiter, slanderer
who amasses wealth and counts it,
thinking his wealth will render him immortal!
On the contrary! He shall be flung to the Crusher.
What shall let you know what the Crusher is?
(It is) the kindled Fire of Allah,
which shall oversee the hearts,
closed around them
in extended columns.
