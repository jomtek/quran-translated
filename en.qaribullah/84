When the sky is torn apart,
hearing and obeying its Lord, as it must do;
when the earth is stretched out
and casts out all that is within and voids itself,
obeying its Lord, as it must do!
O human, you are working hard towards your Lord and you will meet Him.
Then, he who is given his Book in his right hand
shall have an easy reckoning
and will return rejoicing to his family.
But he who is given his Book from behind his back
shall call for destruction
and roast at the Blaze.
Once, he lived joyfully among his family
and surely thought he would never return (to his Lord).
Yes indeed, his Lord was ever watching him.
I swear by the twilight;
by the night and all that it envelops;
by the moon, in its fullness
that you shall surely ride from stage to stage.
What is the matter with them, that they do not believe
and when the Koran is recited to them that they do not prostrate!
No, the unbelievers only belie,
and Allah knows very well what they gather.
Therefore give to them glad tidings of a painful punishment,
except to those who believe, and do righteous deeds, for theirs is an unfailing recompense.
