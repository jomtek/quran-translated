By the night, when it envelops,
and by the day when it unveils.
And by Who created the male and female,
your striving is indeed to different ends!
For him that gives and fears (Allah)
and believes in the finest,
We shall surely ease him to the Path of Easing;
but for him that is a miser, and sufficed,
and he belied the finest
We shall surely ease for him the Path of Hardship (the Fire).
When he falls (into Hell), his wealth will not help him.
Indeed, Guidance is Ours,
and to Us belong the Last and the First.
I have now warned you of the Blazing Fire,
in which none shall be roasted except the most wretched sinner,
who belied and turned away,
and from which the cautious shall be distanced.
He who gives his wealth to be purified,
and confers no favor upon anyone for recompense
seeking only the Face of his Lord, the Most High,
surely, he shall be satisfied.
