Indeed, We have opened for you (Prophet Muhammad) a clear opening,
that Allah forgives your past and future sins, and completes His Favor to you, and guides you on a Straight Path,
and that Allah helps you with a mighty help.
It was He who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers so that they might add belief upon belief. To Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
(From His Wisdom) He admits the believers, both men and women, into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, there to live for ever, and acquit them of their sins that with Allah is a mighty triumph
and that He might punish the hypocrites and the idolaters, both men and women, and those who think evil thoughts of Allah. An evil turn (of fortune) will befall them. The Wrath of Allah is on them, and He has cursed them and prepared for them Gehenna (Hell), an evil arrival!
To Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth. Allah is the Almighty and the Wise.
We have sent you (Prophet Muhammad) as a witness and as a bearer of glad tidings and warning,
so that you believe in Allah and His Messenger and that you support him, revere him (Prophet Muhammad), and exalt Him (Allah), at the dawn and in theevening.
Those who swear allegiance to you swear allegiance to Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. He who breaks his oath breaks it against his self, but for he that keeps his covenant made with Allah, Allah shall give him a mighty wage.
The Bedouins who lagged behind will say to you: 'We were occupied with our possessions and families, so ask Allah to forgive us' But they say with theirtongues what they do not mean in their hearts. Say: 'Who can help you against Allah if it is that He wills harm for you or desires benefit for you? Allah is Aware ofwhat you do'
No, you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and this was made to seem fair in your hearts so you harbored evil thoughts, and so you are a destroyed nation.
But whosoever disbelieves in Allah and His Messenger; We have prepared a Blazing Fire for the unbelievers.
To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He will and punishes whom He will. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
When you set forth to take the spoils, those Bedouins who lagged behind will say: 'Let us follow you' They hope to change the Words of Allah. Say: 'Youshall not follow us. Allah has said so before' They will reply: 'No, you are envious of us' Rather, they have only understood a little!
Say to the Arabs who lagged behind: 'You shall be called upon to fight a mighty nation, unless they embrace Islam. If you are obedient you shall receive agood wage from Allah. But, if you turn away, as you turned your backs before, He will punish you with a painful punishment'
There is no fault in the blind, or the lame, or the sick. He who obeys Allah and His Messenger He shall admit him to Gardens underneath which rivers flow; but he who turns away shall be punished with a painful punishment.
Allah was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree and He knew what was in their hearts. Therefore, He sent downtranquility upon them and rewarded them with a victory close by
and they took many spoils, and Allah is the Almighty, and the Wise.
Allah has promised that you take many spoils. He has hastened this to you, and restrained the hands of people from you so that He makes it a sign to the believers and to guide you on a Straight Path.
And there were (other spoils) which you were unable to take. Allah has encompassed it already, Allah is powerful over all things.
If the unbelievers had fought you they would have been put to flight, and found none to protect or help them.
Such is the way of Allah in days gone by, and you shall find no change in the ways of Allah.
It was He who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the hollow (Hudaibiah) of Mecca after He had given you victory over them. Allah sees the things you do.
They are those who disbelieved and barred you from the Holy Mosque and the offering detained so as not to reach its place of sacrifice if it had not been for certain believing men and certain believing women whom you did not know, you might have trampled upon them, and so sin reached you because of (killing) them while you did not know. In order that Allah admits into His Mercy whom He will, had they (the believers) been easy to distinguish, We would have punished the unbelievers among them with a painful punishment.
And when the unbelievers established in their hearts fierce bigotry, the fierce bigotry of ignorance, Allah sent down His tranquility on His Messenger and the believers and firmly fastened to them the Word of 'taqwa' (there is no god except Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger, as it is the cause of righteousness) to which they have better right and are worthy of it. Allah has knowledge of all things.
Indeed, Allah, in truth, has realized His Messenger's vision. You shall enter the Sacred Mosque in security if Allah wills, with hair shaven or cut short and without fear. He knew what you did not know, and granted you a near victory.
It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, so that He exalts it above all other religions. Allah is the Sufficient Witness.
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Those who are with him are harsh against the unbelievers but merciful to one another. You see them bow andprostrate themselves seeking the bounty and pleasure of Allah. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel, as the seed which puts forth its shoot and strengthens it, so that it grows stout and rises straight upon its stalk, delighting the sowers, and through them He enrages the unbelievers. Allah has promised those of them who believe and do good deeds, forgiveness and a great wage.
