Abundance diverts you,
Until you come to the graves.
Nay! you shall soon know,
Nay! Nay! you shall soon know.
Nay! if you had known with a certain knowledge,
You should most certainly have seen the hell;
Then you shall most certainly see it with the eye of certainty;
Then on that day you shall most certainly be questioned about the boons.
