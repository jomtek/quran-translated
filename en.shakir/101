The terrible calamity!
What is the terrible calamity!
And what will make you comprehend what the terrible calamity is?
The day on which men shall be as scattered moths,
And the mountains shall be as loosened wool.
Then as for him whose measure of good deeds is heavy,
He shall live a pleasant life.
And as for him whose measure of good deeds is light,
His abode shall be the abyss.
And what will make you know what it is?
A burning fire.
