GOD CERTAINLY HEARD what the woman who argued with you about her husband, said, and complained to God; and God heard your interrogation. Verily God hears all, and sees everything.
Those of you who divorce your wives by calling them 'mothers,' cannot (make them) their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. They surely utter what is unseemly and a lie. But God is forbearing and forgiving.
Those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said, should free a slave before having physical contact (with them). This is to warn you, as God is aware of what you do.
If one does not have the means (of doing so) then he should fast for two months continuously before he has physical contact; but any one who is unable to do so, should feed sixty needy persons. This (is enjoined) so that you may be faithful to God and His Apostle. These are the limits set by God. As for the unbelievers, there is painful punishment for them.
Those who oppose God will be disgraced, as those before them were. We have sent down very clear signs. For unbelievers there is a shameful punishment.
On the day when God will raise them up together, He will tell them what they did. God takes account of it although they forget, for all things are evident to God.
Have you not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? No three persons confer secretly but He is the fourth among them, and no five but He is the sixth; and neither fewer nor more but He is with them wheresoever they be. And on the Day of Judgement He will announce their deeds to them. Verily God has knowledge of everything.
Have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire, but reverted after a time to what was forbidden them, and conspired evil, rebellion and disobedience to the Prophet? Yet when they come to you they greet you with a greeting even God does not greet you with; and say to themselves, "Why doesn't God punish us for what we say?" Hell is sufficient for them, in which they will be burnt: And what an evil consequence!
O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered.
Surely scheming is the work of Satan that he may cause the faithful grief; but he cannot harm them unless God dispense. So in God should the believers place their trust.
O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread. When you are told to rise, then rise; God will raise those of you who believe, and those who have knowledge, in position. God is aware of what you do.
O you who believe, if you confer with the Prophet in private, give alms in the name of God before you go to confer. This is better for you and becoming. If you do not have the means, then surely God is forgiving and kind.
Are you afraid of giving alms before confering? Then, if you cannot do this, and God forgives you, be constant in your devotional obligations and pay the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others, and obey God and His Prophet. God is aware of all you do.
Have you not seen those who have taken a people who have roused the wrath of God, as friends? They are neither of you nor of them, and swear to a lie, and knowingly.
God has reserved a severe punishment for them. Evil indeed are the things they do!
They have made their oaths a shield, and obstruct people from the way of God. There is shameful punishment for them.
Neither their wealth nor children will avail them against God. They are the people of Hell, and there will abide for ever.
On the day that God will raise them together, they will swear before Him as they swear before you, and imagine they are on the right path. Is it not they who are liars?
Satan has got the better of them. and made them forget to remember God. Indeed they belong to Satan's faction. Will not Satan's faction perish?
Surely those who oppose God and His Prophet will be among the vilest.
God has decreed: "I will prevail, I and My apostles." Verily God is powerful and all-mighty.
You will not find those who believe in God and the Day of Resurrection, loving those who oppose God and His Prophet, even though they be their fathers, sons, or brothers or their kin. God has inscribed on their hearts belief, and has succoured them with His own grace, and will admit them to gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever, God accepting them, and they, happy in the pleasure of God. They are verily the army of God. Will not the army of God be victorious?
