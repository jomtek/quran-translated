THE STARTLING CALAMITY.
What is the startling calamity?
How will you comprehend what the startling calamity is? --
A Day on which human beings would be like so many scattered moths,
The mountains like the tufts of carded wool.
Then he whose deeds shall weigh heavier in the scale
Will have a tranquil life;
But he whose deeds are lighter in the balance
Will have the Abyss for abode.
How will you comprehend what that is?
It is the scorching fire.
