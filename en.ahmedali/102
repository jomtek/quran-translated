THE AVARICE OF plenitude keeps you occupied
Till you reach the grave.
But you will come to know soon; --
Indeed you will come to know soon.
And yet if you knew with positive knowledge
You have indeed to behold Hell;
Then you will see it with the eye of certainty.
Then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures.
