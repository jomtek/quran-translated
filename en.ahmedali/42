HA MIM.
'Am Sin Qaf.
So has God, all-mighty and all-wise, been revealing to you and to others before you.
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth, belongs to Him. He is all-high and supreme.
The skies are near to bursting asunder above them (for awe of Him), and the angels sing the praises of their Lord, imploring forgiveness for the dwellers of the earth. Is it not that God is forgiving and merciful?
Those who have taken protectors other than Him, are watched over by God. It is not for you to be their guardian.
We have, therefore, revealed to you the eloquent Qur'an that you may warn the people of the Metropolis, and those who live around it, of the Day of Gathering, of which there is no doubt, (when mankind would be assembled) some in Heaven, some in Hell.
If God had pleased He would have made them one community of belief; but He admits whom He please to His grace; yet the sinners have neither friend nor helper.
Have they taken others beside Him as protectors? It is God who protects; it is He who gives life to the dead, for He has power over everything.
In whatever matter you disagree the ultimate judgement rests with God. This is God, my Lord; in Him have I placed my trust, if to Him I turn.
Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has made your consorts from among you, and made pairs of cattle. He multiplies you in this way. There is no other like Him. He is all-hearing and all-seeing.
He holds the keys of the heavens and the earth. He increases or decreases the provision of any one He will. He has knowledge of everything.
He has laid down for you the (same) way of life and belief which He had commended to Noah, and which We have enjoined on you, and which We had bequeathed to Abraham, Moses and Jesus, so that they should maintain the order and not be divided among themselves. Heavy is to idolaters what you invite them to. God chooses whom He please for Himself, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him.
Yet they did not differ about it until knowledge came to them, through rivalries among themselves. If the Word of your Lord, (staying) it for a time ordained, had not preceded it, the matter would have been settled among them. But those who came to inherit the Book after them are also in doubt and disturbed about it.
Yet to that (law) you should call them, and be constant as commanded. Do not follow their passing whims, but say: "I believe in whatever Scripture God has revealed, and I am commanded to act with equivalence among you. God is our Lord and your Lord. To us our actions, to you your deeds. There is no dispute between you and us. God will gather us all together, and to Him is our returning."
As for those who argue in the matter of God after He has been fully acknowledged, their disputing has no force with their Lord. Upon them is (God's) anger, and the punishment for them will be severe.
It is God who has sent down the Book with the truth, and the Balance. How do you know the Hour is not near?
Only they who do not believe in it wish to hasten it; but those who believe are in fear of it, for they know it to be true. Surely those who are in doubt about the Hour are wandering far astray.
God is gracious to His creatures, and bestows favours on whosoever He will. He is all-powerful and all-mighty.
Whoever desires the fruits of the Hereafter, We shall add to his fruit. As for him who desires the fruits of this world, We shall give to him of these, but he will have no share in the Hereafter.
Have they other associates who have prescribed another law for them which has not been dispensed by God? But for the decisive Word (of God) a sentence would have been passed amongst them. Surely there is a grievous punishment for the ungodly.
You will see the evil-doers full of fear of what they deserve, yet it will come to pass. But those who believe and do the right will be in gardens of Paradise. They will receive what they wish from their Lord; and this will be the greatest favour.
This is the good news that God gives to His creatures who believe and do good. Say: "I ask no recompense of you for it other than obligations of relationship." We shall give more excellence to him who acquires excellence. Surely God forgives and accepts (gratitude).
Do they say he has fabricated a lie about God? He could have sealed your hearts if He pleased; but God blots out the false and vindicates the truth by His dispensations, for He knows the secrets of the hearts.
It is He who accepts repentance from His creatures and forgives their trespasses, for He knows what you do.
He answers (the prayers) of those who believe and do good, and gives them more of His bounty. But for the unbelievers there is severe punishment.
If God were to give in abundance to His creatures they would fill the earth with oppression. So He gives according to measure as He will. He knows (what is good for) His creatures. He is all-aware and all-seeing.
It is He who sends down rain when they had despaired of it, and showers His benevolence. He is the protector worthy of praise.
The creation of the heavens and the earth and all the living things dispersed in them, are a sign of His. He has the power to gather them together when He will.
Whatever misfortune befalls you is a consequence of your deeds; yet He forgives much.
You cannot thwart Him on the earth, and have no friend or helper apart from Him.
Ships sailing in the ocean like ensigns are a sign of His.
He could stop the wind if He pleased, then they would be stranded on its surface. Surely there are signs in this for every one who perseveres and is grateful.
Or He could wreck them for what they have done; yet there is much that He pardons.
Let those who dispute Our signs know that there is no way of escape for them.
Whatsoever you have been given is only this life's merchandise; but what is with God is better and more lasting for those who believe and place their trust in their Lord,
Who avoid the deadly sins, immoral acts, and forgive when they are angered,
Who obey the commands of their Lord and fulfil their devotional obligations, whose affairs are settled by mutual consultation, who spend of what We have given them,
And those who defend themselves when they are wronged.
The retribution of evil is the equal of evil (done); yet those who forgive and rehabilitate will be rewarded by God. Verily He does not like those who do wrong.
If one avenges himself after he has been wronged, there is no way of blaming him.
Blame lies on those who oppress, and terrorise the land unjustly. For them there is painful punishment.
But he who bears with patience and forgives, surely complies with divine resolve.
He whom God leads astray has no one except God to protect him. You should see the sinners when they face the punishment. They will say: "Isn't there a way of going back?"
You should see them brought before the Fire, abject in disgrace, looking stealthily. And those who believe will say: "They who forfeit their souls and families on the Day of Resurrection will really be losers." Is it not that sinners will suffer a lasting torment?
They will have no protector to help them other than God. He whom God allows to go astray has no way.
Hearken to your Lord before the Day arrives from God that will not be averted. You will have no place of refuge then nor time for denying.
If they turn away (you are not responsible); We have not appointed you a warden over them. Your duty is to deliver the message. When We let man taste of Our favours he begins to exult; but if misfortune befalls him, as a consequence of his own deeds, man is surely then ungrateful.
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatsoever He wills, bestows daughters on whosoever He will, and gives sons to whom He choose.
On some He bestows both sons and daughters, and some He leaves issueless. He is all-knowing and all-powerful.
It is not given to man that God should speak to him except by suggestion or indirectly, or send a messenger to convey by His command whatsoever He please. He is all-high and all-wise.
So have We revealed to you the Qur'an by Our command. You did not know what the Scripture was before, nor (the laws of) faith. And We made it a light by which We show the way to those of Our creatures as We please; and you certainly guide them to the right path,
The path of God to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And will not all things go back to God?
