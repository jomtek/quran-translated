I CALL THE night to witness when it covers over,
And the day when it shines in all its glory,
And Him who created the male and female,
That your endeavour is for different ends.
Yet he who gives to others and has fear,
And affirms goodness,
We shall ease the way of fortune for him.
But he who does not give and is unconcerned,
And rejects goodness,
For him We shall ease the way of adversity,
And his riches will not avail him when he falls headlong (into the Abyss).
It is indeed for Us to show the way,
And to Us belong the End and the Beginning.
So, I warn you of the blazing Fire.
No one will burn in it but the most wretched,
Who denied (the truth) and turned away.
But save him who fears
And gives of his wealth that he may grow in virtue,
And is under no one's obligation to return his favour,
Other than seeking the glory of his Lord, most high,
Will surely be gratified.
