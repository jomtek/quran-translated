I CALL TO witness the Fig and the Olive,
The Mount Sinai,
And this Soil Secure,
That We created man of finest possibilities,
Then brought him down to the lowest of the low,
Except those who believe and do the right, for whom there is reward undiminished.
Who should then make you deny the Judgement after this?
Is not God the most equitable of all judges?
