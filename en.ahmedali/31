These are the verses of the sagacious Book,
And a guidance and grace for those who do good,
Who are constant in devotion, pay the zakat, and are certain of the Hereafter.
They are on guidance from their Lord, and will prosper.
But among men are also those who spread frivolous stories to mislead (others) from the way of God, without any knowledge, and take it lightly. For such as these the nemesis will be shameful.
When Our verses are recited before them they turn away haughtily as though they did not hear them, as if a deafness had come into their ears. So give them tidings of a shameful punishment.
Surely for those who believe and do the right are pleasure gardens.
They will abide in them for ever. The promise of God is true; and He is all-mighty and all-wise.
He created the skies without a support, as you can see, and placed stabilisers in the earth that you may dwell at ease as it revolves; and dispersed on it all varieties of creatures, and He sent down water from the skies and grew all kinds of splendid things upon it.
Such is God's creation. Show me now what those (they worship) beside Him have created. Surely the evil-doers are in clear error.
We bestowed wisdom on Luqman that he may be grateful to God. Whosoever is grateful is so for his own good, and whoever is ungrateful (should remember) that God is above all concern, worthy of praise.
(Remember) when Luqman counselled his son: "O son, do not associate any one with God. To associate others with God is a grievous wrong."
We have committed man about his parents. His mother carries him in her womb in weakness and debility, weaning him in two years. So he should be grateful to Me and his parents. To Me is the journeying back.
If they try to force you to associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. Live with them honourably in the world, but follow the way of him who turns to Me. Your returning is to Me in the end, when I will tell you what you did.
"O my son, whatsoever it may be, even though equal to a mustard seed in weight, or within a rock or in the sky or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily God is perceptive, all-aware.
O my son, fulfil your moral obligations, bid what is known to be right and forbid what is wrong, and bear with patience what befalls you. These are indeed acts of courage and resolve.
Do not hold men in contempt, and do not walk with hauteur on the earth. Verily God does not like the proud and boastful.
Be moderate in your bearing, and keep your voice low. Surely the most repulsive voice is the donkey's."
Have you not seen that God has subjugated what is in the heavens and the earth to you, and bestowed His favours, external and esoteric, in abundance on you? And yet there are men who contend about God without any knowledge or guidance or the Book enlightening.
When you ask them to follow what God has revealed, they say: "No. We shall follow what we found our ancestors following," even though the devil were calling them to the torment of Hell!
He who turns his face to God in submission and does good, holds fast to a handle that is strong; for the resultance of things rests with God.
So do not let the unbelief of disbelievers grieve you. They will be brought back to Us, when We shall tell them what they used to do. Whatever is in their hearts is known to God.
We let them enjoy themselves only for a while, then We shall drag them to a severe punishment.
If you ask them: "Who created the heavens and the earth?" They will surely answer: "God." Say: "All praise be to God." But most of them do not understand.
To God belongs what is in the heavens and the earth. Verily He is all-sufficient, worthy of praise.
If all the trees of the earth were pens and the oceans ink, with many more oceans for replenishing them, the colloquy of God would never come to end. He is indeed all-mighty and all-wise.
Your creation and resurrection is but like that of a single cell. Verily He is all-hearing and all-seeing.
Do you not see that God makes the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night? And He has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs its appointed course. Surely God is aware of all you do.
That is so for God is the Reality, and what they invoke other than Him is illusion. Indeed God is all-high and supreme.
Do you not see that the ships sail in the ocean by the grace of God, that He may show you some of His glories. Verily there are signs in this for those who are constant and give thanks.
When the waves overshadow them like a canopy, they pray to God with all-exclusive faith in Him. But after He has safely brought them to the shore, there are some who vacillate between doubt and belief, but no one rejects Our signs except those who are perverse and disbelieve.
O people, fear your Lord and dread the day when no father will avail a son, nor son his father. Truly the promise of God is true. Do not be deluded by the life of this world, and do not let the deceiver draw you away from God.
Only God has the knowledge of the Hour. He sends rain from the heavens, and knows what is in the mothers' wombs. No one knows what he will do on the morrow; no one knows in what land he will die. Surely God knows and is cognisant.
