WHEN THE WORLD is shaken up by its cataclysm,
And the earth throws out its burdens,
And man enquires: "What has come over it?"
That day it will narrate its annals,
For your Lord will have commanded it.
That day people will proceed separately to be shown their deeds.
Whosoever has done even an atom's weight of good will behold it;
And whosoever has done even an atom's weight of evil will behold that.
