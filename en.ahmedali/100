I CALL TO witness the chargers, snorting, rushing to battle before the others,
Then those striking sparks of fire,
Then those charging in the morning
Raising clouds of dust,
Penetrating deep into the armies,
That man is ungrateful to his Lord
And is himself witness to it,
And is intractable in his love of worldly goods.
Does he not know when the contents of the graves are laid bare
And the secrets of the hearts exposed,
Surely their Lord will be aware of their (deeds).
