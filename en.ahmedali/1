In the name of Allah, most benevolent, ever-merciful.
ALL PRAISE BE to Allah, Lord of all the worlds,
Most beneficent, ever-merciful,
King of the Day of Judgement.
You alone we worship, and to You alone turn for help.
Guide us (O Lord) to the path that is straight,
The path of those You have blessed, Not of those who have earned Your anger, nor those who have gone astray.
