HAS NEWS OF the Overpowering Event reached you?
Many faces will be contrite on that day,
Labouring, wearied out,
Burning in the scorching fire,
Given water from the boiling spring to drink.
They will have no food except bitter thorn,
Neither nourishing nor banishing hunger.
Many faces will be joyous on that day,
Well-pleased with their endeavour,
In the high empyrean,
Never hearing idle talk.
There is a stream of running water in it;
And within it are couches placed on high,
Goblets set,
Cushions arranged,
And rich carpets spread.
Do they not then ponder how the clouds were formed;
And the heavens, how it was raised high;
And the mountains, how they were fixed;
And the earth, how it was spread out?
Remind them; you are surely a reminder.
You are not a warden over them,
Other than him who turns his back and denies,
In which case he will be punished by God with the severest punishment.
To Us is surely their returning;
Ours is surely then to reckon with them.
