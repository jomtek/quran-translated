WHEN THE SUN is folded up,
The stars turn dim and scatter,
The mountains made to move,
The ten-month pregnant female camels are abandoned,
The wild beasts stampede on the run,
When the oceans surge and swell,
When souls are reunited (with the bodies)
And the little girl buried alive is asked
For what crime she was put to death;
When the ledgers are laid open,
The curtain drawn back from the skies,
When Hell is set ablaze,
And Paradise brought near,
(Then) every soul will know what it had prepared (for itself).
So, I call the receding stars to witness,
The planets withdrawing into themselves,
The closing night,
The rising dawn,
That this is indeed the word of an honoured Messenger,
Full of power, well-established (in position) with the Lord and Master of the Throne,
Obeyed and worthy there of trust.
Your companion is not mad.
He had surely seen Him on the clear horizon.
He is not chary of making public what is unknown.
This is not the utterance of an accursed devil.
So whither do you stray?
This is a reminder for all the peoples of the world,
For those of you who desire to walk the path that is straight,
Though you cannot desire except as God will, the Lord of all the worlds.
