AR-RAHMAN
Bestowed the Qur'an,
Created man,
And taught him to express clearly.
The sun and moon revolve to a computation;
And the grasses and the trees bow (to Him) in adoration.
He raised the sky and set the Balance
So that none may err against the scales,
And observe correct measure, weigh with justice, and not cheat the balance.
He positioned the earth for all the creatures:
There are fruits of all kinds on it, and date-palms with their clusters sheathed,
Grain with husk, and fragrant grasses.

And created jinns from the white-hot flame of fire.
