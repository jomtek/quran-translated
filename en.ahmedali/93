I CALL TO witness the early hours of morning,
And the night when dark and still,
Your Lord has neither left you, nor despises you.
What is to come is better for you than what has gone before;
For your Lord will certainly give you, and you will be content.
Did He not find you an orphan and take care of you?
Did He not find you perplexed, and show you the way?
Did He not find you poor and enrich you?
So do not oppress the orphan,
And do not drive the beggar away,
And keep recounting the favours of your Lord.
