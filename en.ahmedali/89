I CALL TO witness the dawn
And the Ten Nights,
The multiple and the one,
The night as it advances,
Is there not an evidence in this for those who have sense?
Have you not seen what your Lord did to the 'Ad
Of Eram with lofty pillars (erected as signposts in the desert),
The like of whom were never created in the realm;
And with Thamud who carved rocks in the valley;
And the mighty Pharaoh
Who terrorised the region,
And multiplied corruption.
So your Lord poured a scourge of punishment over them.
Your Lord is certainly in wait.
As for man, whenever his Lord tries him and then is gracious and provides good things for him, he says: "My Lord has been gracious to me."
But when He tries him by restraining his means, he says: "My Lord despises me."
No. In fact you are not generous to the orphans,
Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor,
And you devour (others') inheritance greedily,
And love wealth with all your heart.
Surely when We pound the earth to powder grounded, pounded to dust,
And comes your Lord, and angels row on row,
And Hell is brought near, that day will man remember, but of what avail will then remembering be?
He will say: "Alas the woe! Would that I had sent ahead something in my life."
None can punish as He will punish on that day,
And none can bind as He will bind.
O you tranquil soul,
Return to your Lord, well-pleased and well-pleasing Him.
"Enter then among My votaries,
Enter then My garden."
