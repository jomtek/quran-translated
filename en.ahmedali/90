I CALL THIS earth to witness --
And you are free to live upon it, --
And the parent and the offspring,
That We created man in toil and trouble.
Does he think that no one has power over him?
He says: "I have wasted a great deal of wealth."
Does he think that no one sees him?
Did We not give him two eyes,
One tongue, and two lips,
And showed him two highways (of good and evil)?
But he could not scale the steep ascent.
How will you comprehend what the Steep ascent is? --
To free a neck (from the burden of debt or slavery),
Or to feed in times of famine
The orphan near in relationship,
Or the poor in distress;
And to be of those who believe, and urge upon one another to persevere, and urge upon each other to be kind.
They are the people of the right hand (and will succeed).
But those who deny Our revelations are the people of the left hand:
The Fire will vault them over.
