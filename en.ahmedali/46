HA MIM.
The revelation of this Book is from God, the mighty and all-wise.
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but with a purpose for an appointed time. Yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning.
Say: "Have you thought of those you invoke apart from God? Show me what they have created of the earth, or, do they have a share in the heavens? Bring me an earlier Book than this, or inherited knowledge, if you are truthful."
Who is more astray than he who calls on those, apart from God, who cannot answer their prayers till the Day of Resurrection, and are even unaware of being called.
When all men are gathered together (on that Day) they will become their enemies and deny their worship.
When Our clear revelations are read out to them, the infidels say of the truth, when it has come to them: "This is pure magic."
Do they say: "He has fabricated it?" Tell them: "If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God. He knows what you are busy with concerning this. He is sufficient as witness between you and me; yet He is forgiving, ever-merciful."
Say: "I am not a new Messenger to come, nor do I know what is to be done to me or you. I only follow what is revealed to me. My duty is only to warn you clearly."
Tell them: "Think (of the consequence) if this is from God and you deny it when a witness from the people of Israel had testified to the like of it and come to believe, while you spurn it?" Assuredly God does not guide a wicked people.
Those who deny say of those who believe: "Had there been any good in it they would not have preceded us in coming to it." Since they have not taken guidance from it, they will say: "This is the same old lie."
There was the Book of Moses before this, a guide and a mercy; and here is this Book confirming it in lucid language, warning those who are wicked, and giving happy tidings to the righteous.
Surely for those who say, "God is our Lord," and then remain firm, there is no fear or regret.
They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever as a recompense for what they had done.
We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: His mother carries him in her womb with hardship, and gives birth to him in pain. Thirty months is the period of her carrying and weaning him. When he attains to manhood and the age of forty, he says: "O Lord, guide me to thank You for the favours You have bestowed on me and my parents, and to do things good as may please You, and give me a righteous off-spring. I turn to You in penitence and submit."
They are those from whom We accept the very best of what they have done, and overlook their faults. They will be among the inmates of Paradise: A true promise they have been made.
But he who says to his parents: "Shame on you: You intimidate me that I will be resurrected when many generations will have passed before me?" And (the parents) would implore God's help: "Woe to you. You better believe. The promise of God is certainly true." Yet he answers: "These are only fables of long ago."
They are those on whom the sentence of God would be justified as on communities of jinns and men before them. They will surely perish.
Each will have a position in accordance with his deeds; and no wrong will be done to them.
The day the unbelievers are brought to the Fire, (it will be said): "You wasted all your good deeds in the life of the world, and enjoyed them to the full. You will now be requited with a shameful punishment, for you behaved with arrogance for no reason on the earth, and acted wickedly."
Remember (Hud) the brother of 'Ad. When he warned his people in Ahqaf -- though many a warner had come and gone before and after him: "Do not worship any one but God, for I fear the punishment of an awful day for you,"
They said: "Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Then bring upon us what you predict for us, if you are a man of truth."
He said: "Only God has the knowledge. I only convey to you what I have been sent with. But I see you are a foolish people."
So when they saw it as a cloud advancing towards their valleys, they said: "This is just a passing cloud that will bring us rain." "No. It is what you were trying to hasten: The wind which carries the grievous punishment!
It will destroy everything at the bidding of its Lord." So in the morning there was nothing but their empty dwellings to be seen. That is how We requite the sinners.
We had strengthened them as We have not strengthened you, had given them ears and eyes and hearts; but nothing stood them in good stead, neither their ears nor eyes nor hearts, for they rejected the signs of God, and were seized by what they had mocked.
We have destroyed habitations all around you, having explained Our signs in different ways to them that they may turn back.
Why then did the gods they had taken apart from God as propitiators, not come to their aid? In fact they strayed away from them. It was all a lie what they had contrived!
And (remember), when We turned a company of jinns towards you to listen to the Qur'an, they arrived when it was being recited, and they said: "Keep silent." When it was over they came back to their people, warning them:
"O our people:" they said: "we have listened to a Book which has come down after Moses, confirming what was (sent down) before it, showing the way to the truth and a path that is straight.
O our people, hearken to the summoner of God, and believe in him, so that He may forgive you your sins and save you from a painful doom.
He who does not listen to the summoner of God cannot weaken (the power of) God on earth, nor will he have protectors other than Him. They are clearly in the wrong."
Do they not realise that God who created the heavens and the earth, and did not tire creating them, is able to bring the dead to life? And why not? He has the power over everything.
The day the unbelievers will be stood before the Fire, (they will be asked:) "Is this not the reality?" They will answer: "In truth, by our Lord!" It will be said: "Then taste the torment of what you had denied."
So bear with patience, as the apostles who were constant, bore; and do not be hasty (in demanding punishment) for them. On the day they see what they had been foretold, (they will realise) that they did not stay in the world but only an hour of the day. This is the message to be conveyed: Shall any perish but the ungodly?
