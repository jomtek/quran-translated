WHEN THE SKY is cleft asunder,
And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful,
When the earth is stretched out taut
And throws out whatever it contains and is empty,
And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful,
O man, you have to strive and go on striving towards your Lord, then will you meet Him.
And he who is given his ledger in his right hand
Will have an easy reckoning,
And will return to his people full of joy.
But he who is given his ledger from behind his back
Will pray for death,
But will be roasted in the fire.
He lived rejoicing among his people,
Never thinking he will return.
Why not? His Lord was always watching him.
So indeed I call to witness the evening twilight,
And the night and all it gathers,
And the moon when at the full,
That you will climb from stage to stage.
So, wherefore do they not believe?
And when the Qur'an is recited to them do not bow in adoration?
In fact the unbelievers disavow.
But God knows what they harbour in their breasts.
So give them news of painful punishment,
Except those who believe and do the right: For them there is reward unending.
