WOE TO EVERY slanderer, back-biter,
Who amasses wealth and hordes it.
Does he think his wealth will abide for ever with him?
By no means. He will be thrown into Hutama.
How will you comprehend what Hutama is?
It is the fire kindled by God
Which penetrates the hearts
(And) vaults them over
In extending columns.
