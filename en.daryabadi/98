Those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book and the associaters could not break off, until there had come Unto them the evidence.
An apostle from Allah rehearsing Writs cleansed.
Wherein are discourses eternal.
And those who are vouchsafed the Book divided not save after there had come Unto them the evidence.
And they were commanded not but that they should worship Allah, keeping religion pure for him, as upright men, and that they should establish prayer and give the poor-rate, And that is the right religion.
Verily those who disbelieve from among the people of the Book and the associaters shall be cast into the Hell-fire, as abiders therein. These! they are the worst of the creation.
Verily those who believe and work righteous works - these! they are the best of the creation.
Their recompense with their Lord shall be Gardens Everlasting, whereunder rivers flow - as abiders therein for evermore. Well-pleases will be Allah with them and well-pleased will be they with Him, That is for him who feareth his Lord.
