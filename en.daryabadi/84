When the heaven is sundered.
And it hearkeneth to its Lord, and is duteous,
And when the earth shall be stretched forth.
And shall cast forth that which is therein, and shall become empty.
And it hearkeneth to its Lord, and is duteous.
O man! verily thou art toiling toward thy Lord a painful toiling, and art about to meet Him.
Then as to him who shall be given his book in his right hand -
His account shall presently be taken by an easy reckoning.
And he shall return Unto his people joyfully.
And as to him who shall be given his book from behind his back-
He shall presently call for death,
And he shall roast into a Blaze.
Verily he was among his people joyous.
Verily he imagined that he would not be back.
Yea! his Lord had ever been beholding him.
I swear by the afterglow of sunset,
And by the night and that which it driveth together,
And by the moon when she becometh full.
Surely ye shall ride layer upon layer.
What aileth them then, that they believe not,
And that, when the Qur'an is read Unto them, they prostrate not them-selves!
Yea those who disbelieve belie.
Whereas Allah knoweth best that which they cherish.
Wherefore announce thou Unto them a torment afflictive.
But those who believe and work righteous works, theirs shall be a hire unending.
