Hath there come Unto thee the story of the Enveloping Event?
Faces on that Day shall be downcast,
Travailing, worn.
They shall roast into the scalding Fire,
Given to drink of a spring fiercely boiling.
No food shall be theirs save bitter thorn,
Which shall neither nourish nor avail against hunger.
Faces on that Day shall be de lighted,
With their endeavour well pleased.
They shall be in a Garden lofty:
They shall hear therein no vain discourse;
Therein shall be a spring running!
Therein shall be couches elevated!
And goblets ready placed!
And cushions ranged!
And carpets ready spread,
Look they not at the camels, how they are created?
And at the heaven, how it is raised?
And at the mountains, how they are rooted?
And at the earth, how it is outspread?
Admonish thou then; thou art but an admonisher.
Thou art not over them a warden.
But whosoever will turn back and disbelieve -
Him Allah shall torment with the greatest torment.
Verily Unto us is their reckoning.
Then verily on us is their reckoning.
