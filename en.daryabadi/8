They ask thee concerning the spoils of war. Say thou: the spoils of war are Allah's and the apostle's. So fear Allah, and set right the matter among you, and obey Allah and His apostle if ye are believers.
The believers are only those whose hearts thrill with fear when Allah is mentioned, and when His revelations are rehearsed unto them, they increase their faith and who trust in their Lord.
Who establish prayer and who expend of that wherewith We have provided them.
Those: it is they who are the true believers. For them are degrees with their Lord and forgiveness and a provision honourable.
This is like what time thy Lord had caused thee to go forthfrom thy house for a right cause, while a party among the believers were averse.
Disputing with thee respecting the right cause after it had become manifest, as though they were led forth unto death while they looked on.
And recall what time Allah was promising you one of the two parties that it should be yours, and ye would fain to have that the one without; Whilst Allah besought arms were yours to justify the truth by His words and to cut off the root of the infidels.
In order that he might justify the truth and falsify the false even though the guilty ones were averse.
And recall what time ye implored our Lord and He answered you: verily I am about to succour you with a thousand of angels rank in rank.
And Allah made not this save as a glad tidings, and that your hearts might thereby be set at rest; and succour cometh not but from Allah. Verily Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Recall what time He caused slumber to cover you as a security from Himself, and He sent down rain upon you from heaven that he might cleanse you thereby and take away from you the pollution of the Satan, and that he might gird up your hearts and make your feet firm thereby.
And recall what time thy Lord inspired the angels: verily I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed; will cast horror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so smite them above the neck and smite of them every fingertip.
This, because they have resisted Allah and His apostle; and whosoever resisteth Allah and His apostle, then verily Allah severe in retribution.
This! taste it then, and know that for the infidels is the torment of the Fire.
O Ye who believe! whenever ye those who disbelieve matching meet slowly turn to them not your backs.
And whosoever turneth his back to them on such a day, unless it be swerving to a fight or wriggling round to anot her company, hath surely drawn upon himself indignation from Allah, and his resort is Hell--an evil destination!
Wherefore ye slew them not, but Allah slew them, and thou thrtwest not, When thou threWest, but Allah threw, in order that he might prove the believers with a goodly proving from Him. Verily Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
Thus! And know that Allah weakenoth the contrivance of infidels.
If ye besought a judgement then surely a judgement hath come unto you. And if ye desist it Will be better for you; and if ye return. We will return; and your host shall avail you not, although numerous it be; and know that verily Allah is with the believers.
O Ye who believe! obey Allah and His apostle and turn not away therefrom while ye hearken.
And be not like unto those who say: we hear, whereas they hearken not.
Verily the vilest of beasts with Allah are the deaf and dumb who understand not.
And had Allah known in them any good He would surely have made them hearken; and even if He made them hear, they would surely turn away as backsliders.
O Ye who believe! answer Allah and the apostle when he calleth you to that which quickeneth you, and know that verily Allah interposeth between a man and his heart, and that verily unto Him ye all shall be gathered.
And fear the trial that shall not afflict those alone who among you do Wrong; and know that verily Allah severe in chastising.
And remember what time ye were few and downtrodden in the land fearing that the people would snatch you away; then He gave you refuge and strengthened you with His succour, and provided you with good things that haply ye might return thanks.
O Ye who believe! defraud not Allah and the apostle, nor defraud your trusts while ye know.
And know that your riches and your children are but a temptation, and that verily Allah: with Him is a mighty hire.
O Ye who believe! if ye fear Allah He will make for you a distinction and will expiate for you your misdeeds, and forgive you; and Allah is Owner of Mighty Grace.
And recall what time those who disbelieved were plotting against thee to confine thee or to slay thee or to drive thee forth: they were plotting and Allah was plotting, and Allah is the Best of plotters.
And when Our revelations are rehearsed unto them, they say: we have heard; we could if we willed, surely say something the like thereof; naught is this but fables of the ancients.
And recall what time they said: O God! if this indeed be the truth from before Thee, then rain down stones upon us from heaven or bring on us a torment afflictive.
And Allah is not one to chastise them whilst thou art in their midst, nor was Allah going to chastise them while they were asking forgiveness.
And what aileth them that Allah should not chastise them when they are hindering people from the Sacred Mosque, whereas they are not even the keepers thereof - its keepers are none but the God-fearing-- but most of them know not.
And naught was their prayer at the House but whistling and hand-clapping. Taste then the torment for ye were to disbelieve.
Verily those who disbelieve are expending their riches in order to hinder People from the way of Allah; so they will go on expending them; thereafter they shall become an anguish unto them; then they shall be overcome. And those who disbelieve shall be gathered for Hell.
In order that Allah may distinguish the vile from the good; and the vile He shall place one upon anot her, and shall pile it all together, and shall place it into Hell. Those! it is they who are the losers.
Say thou unto those who have disbelieved: if they desist, that which is past shall be forgiven them, and if they return, then already gone forth is the dispensation of the ancients.
And fight against them until there be no temptations and their obedience be wholly unto Allah. So if they desist, thens verily Allah is the Beholder of that which they do.
And if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Patron: excellent Patron! and excellent helper!
And know that whatsoever ye obtain of spoils then verily unto Allah belongeth a fifth thereof and unto the apostle and unto his kindreds and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer if ye indeed have believed in Allah and that which We sent down on our bondmans on the day of distinction, the day whereon the two hosts met. And Allah is over everything Potent.
And recall what time ye were on the hither side and they were on the yonder side and the caravan below you. And if ye had mutually appointed ye would surely have failed the appointment. But the action wao brought about in order that Allah may decree an affair already enacted, so that he who was to perish, should perish after an evidence and he who was to remain alive may remain alive after an evidence. And verily Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And recall what time Allah shewed them few unto thee in thy dream. And had He shewn them numerous unto thee, surely ye would have flagged and surely ye would have disputed over the affair but Allah saved you. Verily He is the Knower of that which is in the breasts.
And recall what time He shewed them few in your eyes when ye met and lessened you in their eyes in order that Allah might decree an affair already enacted; and unto Allah are all affairs returned.
O Ye who believe! when ye meet a party, stand firm and remember Allah much, that haply ye may fare well.
And obey Allah and His apostle, and dispute not, lest ye flag and your predominance depart, and be patient. Verily Allah is with the patient
And be not like unto those who came forth from their homes vaunting and to be seen of men and hindering others from the way of Allah; and Allah is the Ecompasser of that which they work.
And recall what time the Satan made their works fair- seeming unto them and said: there is none of mankind to overcome you to- day, and verily I am your neighbour. Then when the two parties faced each other, he turned on his heels, and said: verily I am quit of you, verily I behold that which ye behold not; verily I fear Allah: and Allah severe in retribution.
And recall what time the hypocrites and these in whose hearts was a disease said: their religion hath be gulfed those. And whosoever relieth on Allah then verily Allah is Mighty, Wise.
And couldst thou behold when the angels take away the life of those who disbelive striking their faces and their backs: taste the torment of burning.
This, because of that which your hands have sent forth, and verily Allah is never unjust unto His creatures.
Like are they unto the wont of the house of Fir'awn and those before them. They disbelieved in the signs of Allah, wherefore Allah laid hold of them for their sins. Verily Allah is strong, Severe in retribution.
This, because Allah is not one to change His favour wherewith He hath favoured a people until they have changed that which is in themselves; and verily Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
Like are they Unto the wont of the house of Fir'awn and those before them. They belied the signs of their Lord; wherefore We destroyed them for their sins, and drowned the house of fir'awn; and all of them were wrong-doers.
Verily the vilest of moving creatures with Allah are those who disbelieve-wherefore they shall not believe-
They with whom thou covenantedest, then they break their covenant every time, and they fear not.
Wherefore if thou over-takest them in war, disperse thou through them those behind them, that haply they may be admonished.
And shouldst thou fear treachery from any people cast back then unto them their covenant to be equal. Verily Allah approveth not the treacherous.
Let not those who disbelieve deem that they have escaped, verily they cannot frustrate.
And get ready against them whatsoever ye can of force and wellfed horses whereby ye may overawe the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom ye know not Allah knoweth them. And whatsoever ye expend in the way of Allah shall be repaid to you in full; and ye shall not be wronged.
And if they incline unto peace, then thou mayest incline thereunto, and rely thou on Allah; verily He is the Hearer, the Knower.
And if they seek to deceive thee, then verily Allah is sufficient unto thee. He it is who aided thee with His succour and with the believers.
And He united their hearts. Hadst thou expended all that is on the earth thou couldst not have united their hearts, but Allah united them; verily He is Mighty, Wise.
0 Prophet! sufficient unto thou is Allah and those who follow thee of believers.
0 Prophet! urge the believers unto fighting. If there be twenty of you persevering, they will overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a hundred, they will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, for they are a people who understand not.
Now Allah hath lightened your burden, and He knoweth that verily there is in you a weakness. So if there be a hundred of you persevering, they will overcome two hundred, and if there be a thousand of you they will overcome two thousand, by the command of Allah and Allah is with the persevering.
It behoveth not a prophet that he should have captives until he hath greatly slaughtered in the land. Ye seek the gear of the world, while Allah seeketh the Hereafter; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Were it not that a writ had already gone forth from Allah, there would surely have touched you a mighty torment for that which ye took
Eat ye then of that which ye have obtained of spoi1, lawful and clean, fear Allah; verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful
O Prophet! say Unto the captives who are in your hands: if Allah knoweth any good in Your hearts He will give you better than that which hath been taken away from you, and shall forgive you; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And if they seek defrauding thee, then they have defrauded Allah before, yet he gave thee power over them; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
Verily those who believed and emigrated and strave hard in the way of Allah with their riches and lives'and those who sheltered and succoured: those shall be heirs unto one anot her. And those who believed but emigrated not, ye have naught of inheritance to do with them, unless they emigrate. And should they seek succour from you in the matter of religion, then incumbent on you is the succour, except against a people between whom and you there is a compact. And Allah is the Beholder of that which ye work.
And those who disbelieve: they shall be heirs unto one anot her. if ye do this not, a sedition there will be in the land and a great corruption.
And those who believe and have emigrated and striven hard in the way of Allah, those who sheltered and succoured --these! they are the believers in very truth; for them shall be forgiviness and honourable provision.
And those who believed after wards and emigrated and strave hard along with you: these also are of you; and the kindred by blood are nearer unto one anot her in Allah's decree; verily Allah is of everything the Knower.
