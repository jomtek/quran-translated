Woe Unto every slanderer, traducer,
Who amasseth wealth; and counteth it.
He bethinketh that his wealth shall abide for him.
By no means! He shall surely be cast into the Crushing Fire.
And what shall make thee know that which the Crushing Fire is?
Fire of Allah, Kindled,
Which mounteth up to the hearts.
Verily it shall close upon them,
In pillars stretched forth.
