Alif. Lam Mim
This Book whereof there is no doubt, is a guidance unto the God-fearing.
Who believe in the Unseen, and establish prayer, and out of that wherewith We have provided them expend.
And who believe in that which hath been sent down unto thee and that which hath been sent down before thee and of the Hereafter they are convinced.
These are on guidance from their Lord, and these they are the blissful ones.
Verily those who have disbelieved, it is equal to them whether thou warnest them or warnest them not; they will not believe.
Allah hath set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their sights is a covering; and unto them shall be a torment mighty.
And of mankind are some who say: we believe in Allah and in the Last Day: whereas they are not believers.
They would deceive Allah and those who believe, whereas they deceive not save themselves, and they perceive not.
In their hearts is a disease, so Allah hath increased unto them that disease; and unto them shall be a torment afflictive, for they have been lying.
And when it said unto them: act not corruptly on the earth, they say: we are but reconcilers.
Lo! verily it is they who are the corrupters, and yet they perceive not.
And when it said unto them: believe even as mankind have believed, they say: shall we believe even as the fools have believed? Lo! verily it is they who are the fools; and yet they know not.
And when they meet those who have believed, they say: We believe. And when they are alone with their Satans, they say: verily we are with you, we were but mocking.
Allah mocketh back at them, and letteth them in their exorbitance wander bewildered.
These are they who purchased error for guidance, but their traffic profited not, nor have they ever become guided.
Their likeness is as the likeness of him who kindleth a fire, then when it hath lit up that which is around him, Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darknesses where they see not
Deaf, dumb, blind; wherefore they will not return.
like unto a rain--laden cloud from heaven, wherein are darknesses and thunder and lightening. They so put their fingers in their ears because of the thunder-claps, guarding against death, and Allah is Encompasser of the infidels.
The lightning well-nigh snatcheth away their sight; whensoever it flasheth on them, they walk therein, and when it becometh dark unto them, they stand still. And had Allah willed He would of a surety have taken away their hearing and their sights; verily Allah is over everything potent.
O Mankind worship your Lord who hath created you and those before you, haply ye may become God-fearing-
Who hath made the earth for you a carpet and the heaven a structure, and sent down from heaven water, and brought forth therewith fruits as a Provision for you; wherefore set not up compeers unto Allah while ye know.
And if ye be in doubt concerning that which We have revealed unto Our bondsman, then bring a chapter like thereunto, and call your witnesses as against Allah, if ye say sooth.
But if ye do it not, --and by no means ye shall, --then dread the Fire, the fuel whereof is men and stones, gotten ready for the infidels.
And bear thou the glad tidings unto those who believe and do righteous works that verily for them shall be Gardens whereunder rivers flow. So oft as they shall be provided with a fruit therefrom they will say: this is that wherewith we were provided afore; and they shall be vouchsafed that which is consimilar; and for them shall be therein spouses purified, and therein they shall be abiders.
Verily Allah is not ashamed to propound a similitude, be it of a gnat or of aught above it. Then as to those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And to those who disbelieve, they say what intendeth God by similitude? He sendeth many astray thereby, and He guideth many thereby, and He sendeth not astray thereby any except the transgressors,
Who break the covenant of Allah after the ratification thereof, and sunder that which Allah hath commanded should be joined, and act corruptly on the earth. These! they are the losers.
How will ye disbelieve in Allah whereas ye were lifeless and he quickened you; thereafter He will cause you to die, thereafter He will give you life, thereafter unto Him ye shall be returned!
He it is who created for you all that is on the earth, thereafter He turned to the heaven, and formed them seven heavens. And He is of everything the Knower.
And recall what time thine Lord said unto the angels: verily I am going to place a vicegerent On the earth. They said: wilt Thou place therein one who will act corruptly therein and shed blood While we hallow Thine praise and glorify Thee! Allah said: verily I know that which ye know not.
And He taught Adam the names, all of them; thereafter He set them before the angles, and said declare unto Me the names of those if ye say sooth.
They said: hallowed be Thou no knowledge is our save that which Thou hast taught us, verily Thou! Thou art the Knower, Wise.
Allah said: O Adam! declare thou unto them the names of those objects. Then when he had declared unto them the names of those, He said: said I not unto you, verily I know the hidden in the heavens and the earth, and know that which ye disclose and that which ye are wont to conceal!
And recall what time We said unto the angels: prostrate yourselves before Adam, they prostrated themselves; but not Iblis he refused and was stiff - necked and became of the infidels.
And We said: Adam! dwell thou and thine spouse in the Garden, and eat ye twain plenteously thereof as ye list, but approach not yonder tree, lest yet twain become of the wrong-doers.
Then the Satan caused the twain to slip on account thereof, and drave them forth from that which the twain were in. And We said: get ye down, one of you an enemy unto anot her, and for you on the earth shall be a resting-place and enjoyment for a season.
Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain Words, and He relented toward him, verily He! He is the Relentant, the Merciful.
We said: get ye all down from hence, and if there cometh unto you a guidance from Me, then whosoever shall follow Mine guidance, -- no fear shall come on them, nor shall they grieve.
And those who disbelieve and belie Our signs, --they, shall be fellows of the Fire; therein they shall be abiders.
Children of Israel! remember My favour wherewith favoured you, and fulfil My covenant, and shall fulfil your covenant, and Me alone shall ye dread.
And believe in that which I have sent down confirming that which is with you, and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and barter not My revelations for a small price, and Me alone shall ye fear.
And confound not the truth with falsehood, nor hide the truth while ye know.
And establish prayer, and give the poor-rate, and bow down with those who bow down.
Command ye mankind to piety and forget yourselves, the while ye read the Book! Understand then ye not!
And seek help in patience and prayer and verily it is, hard except prayer unto the meek.
Who know that verily they are going to meet their Lord, and that verily unto Him they are going to return,
O Children of Israel: remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and that verily I preferred you over the world.
And fear a Day whereon not in aught shall a soul satisfy for a soul, nor shall intercession be accepted thereof, shall compensation be received therefor, nor shall they be succoured.
And recall what time We delivered you from the house of Fir'awn imposing upon you evil torment, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live; and therein was a trial, from your Lord, Mighty.
And recall what time We separated the sea for you and delivered you and drowned Fir'awn's house while ye looked on.
And recall what time We treated with Musa forty nights, then ye betook the calf after him, and ye were wrong-doers.
Then We pardoned you thereafter, that haply ye may return thanks.
And recall what time We vouchsafed unto Musa the Book and the distinction that haply ye may be guided.
And recall what time Musa said unto his people: my people! verily ye have wronged your souls by your taking the calf, wherefore repent unto your Maker, and slay yourselves: that were best for you with your Maker. Then He relented toward you; verily He! He is the Relentant, the Merciful
And recall what time ye said: O Musa! we will not believe in thee until we see God openly; then a thunderbolt took hold of you while ye looked on.
Then We raised you after your death that haply ye may return thanks.
And We overshadowed you with Clouds and We sent down unto you the Manna and the quails, saying: eat of the clean things, wherewith We have provided you. And they wronged Us not, but themselves they were wont to wrong.
And recall what time We said: enter this town and eat plenteously therefrom as ye list, and enter the gate prostrating yourselves and say: forgiveness; We shall forgive you your trespasses, and anon We shall increase unto the well-doers.
Then those who did wrong changed the Word that had been told them for anot her; so We sent down upon those who did wrong a scourge from heaven, for they were wont to transgress.
And recall what time Musa prayed for drink for his people. We said: smite With thy staff the stone. Then there gushed forth thereout twelve springs; every people already knew their drinking-place; eat and drink of the provision of Allah, and commit not evil on the earth as corrupters.
And recall what time ye said: O Musa! we shall by no means bear patiently with one food, wherefore supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth, of its vegetables, and its cucumbers, and its Wheat, and its lentils, and its onions. He Said: would ye take in exchange that which is mean for that which is better! Get ye down into a City, as verily therein is for you that which ye ask for. And stuck upon them were abjection and poverty. And they drew on themselves indignation from Allah. This, because they were ever disbelieving in the signs of Allah and slaying the prophets without justice. This, because they disobeyed and were ever trespassing.
Verily those who believe, and those who are Judaised, and the Nazarenes, and the Sabians, - whosoever, believeth in Allah and the Last Day and worketh righteously, these! unto them shall be their hire with their Lord, no feal shall come on them nor shall they grieve.
And recall what time We took your bond, and raised over you the Tur saying: hold fast to that which We have vouchsafed unto you, and remember that which is therein, that haply ye may become God-fearing.
Then ye turned away there after; so had not the grace of Allah been unto you and His mercy, ye had surely become of the losers.
And assuredly ye know of those of you who trespassed in the matter of the Sabbath, wherefore We said unto them: be ye apes despised.
And We made it a deterrent unto those of their day and those after them, and an exhortation unto the God-fearing.
And recall what time Musa said unto his people: verily Allah commandeth you that ye slaughter a cow. They said: makest thou a jest of us? He said take refuge with Allah that I should be of the ignorant.
They said: supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He make manifest unto us whatever she should be. He said: verily He saith, she should be a cow neither old nor young, but middle-aged betwixt that; do then as ye are commanded.
They said: supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He make manifest unto us whatever her colour should be. He said: verily He saith, she should be a yellow cow the colour whereof is deepest, delighting the beholders.
They said supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He make manifest unto us whatever she should be, for verily the cow hath become dubious unto us and verily we, if God will, shall beguided.
He said: verily He saith, verify she should be a cow unyoked, not broken to till the ground or to water the field, whole, and without blemish in her. They said: now hast thou brought the truth. Then they slaughtered her, and they were wellnigh not doing it.
And recall what time ye slew a person, then quarrelled among yourselves respecting it, and Allah was to bring out that which ye were hiding.
Wherefore We said: smite him with part of her. Thus will Allah quicken the dead and He sheweth you His signs that haply ye may under stand.
Then your hearts hardened thereafter, so they are as stones or stronger in hardness: and verily of stones there are some from which gush forth rivers, and verily there are of them some that cleave asunder and water issueth therefrom, and verily there are of them some that fall down in awe of Allah: and Allah is not neglectful of that which ye work.
Covet ye then that they would believe for you whereas surely a Party of them hath been hearing the Word of Allah and then reverting it after they have understood it, While they know.
And when they meet those who believe they say: we believe; and when some of them are alone with some others they say speak ye unto them of that which God hath opened unto you so that they may argue therewith against you before your Lord? understand then ye not?
Know they not that Allah knoweth that which they hide and that which they make known?
And of them are unlettered ones who know not the Book but vain desires; and they do but conjecture.
Woe then unto those who write out the Book with their hands and say thereafter: this is from God, that they may barter it for a small price. Woe then unto them for that which thei hands had written; and woe unto them for that which they earn therwith.
And they say: Fire shall touch us not save for a few numbered days. Say thou: have ye taken a covenant with Allah, so that Allah shall not fail His covenant? or fabricate ye against Allah that which ye know not
O Yea! whosoever earnoth vice and his sin hath encompassed him, those shall be the fellows of the Fire, as abiders therein.
And those who believe and do righteous works, --those shall be the fellows of the Garden, as abiders therein.
And recall what time We took a bond with the Children of Israel saying: worship not any god save Allah, and unto parents show kindness, and also unto the kindred and the orphans and the poor, and speak kindly unto mankind, and establish prayer and give the poor rate. Then ye turned away, save a few of you, and ye are backsliders.
And recall what time We took a bond with you: saying: ye shall not shed your blood, nor drive one anot her from your homes; then ye ratified it and ye Were witnesses
Thereafter it is ye the very ones who slay each other and drive a party of you from their homes, and back up against them with guilt and iniquity; and if they come unto you as captives, ye ransom them, whereas forbidden unto you was their driving away itself. Believe ye then in part of the Book and disbelieve in part? What, then, is to be the meed of those of you who do that, save humiliation in the life of the world? And on the Day of Judgement they shall be brought back to the severest torment, and Allah is not neglectful of that which ye work.
These are they who have purchased the life of the world for the Hereafter; wherefore the torment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be succoured.
And assuredly We vouchsafed unto Musa the Book and We followed him up by the apostles after him, and unto 'lsa, son of Maryam, We vouchsafed evidences and aided him with the Holy Spirit. Then so often as there came unto you an apostle with that which your souls desired not, ye waxed stiff necked; and some ye belied and some ye slew?
And they say: our hearts are uncircumcised. Nay! Allah hath cursed them because of their infidelity: little wherefore it is they believe.
And when there came unto them a Book from before Allah confirming that which was with them, --and afore they were entreating God for victory over these who disbelieved, -then when there came unto them that which they recognised. they disbelieved therein wherefore Allah's curse be on the infidels!
Vile is that for which they have bartered their souls, that they should disbelieve that which Allah hath sent down, out of envy that Allah should reveal, out of His grace, unto whosoever of His bond men He listeth. Wherefore they have drawn upon themselves wrath upon wrath, and unto the infidel shall be a torment ignominious.
And when it said unto them believe in that which Allah hath sent down now, they say: we believe in that which hath been sent down unto Us. And they disbelieve in that which is besides that while it is the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say thou: wherefore then slew ye Allah's prophets afore, a if ye have been believers?
And assuredly Musa came unto you with evidence, then ye betook the calf after him, and ye were wrong-doers.
And recall what time We took your bond and raised over you the Tur, saying: hold fast to that which We have vouchsafed unto you and hearken. They said: we hear and we disobey. And into their hearts the calf was made to sink because of their infidelity. Say thou: vile is that which your belief commandeth you, if ye are believers.
Say thou: if for you alone is the abode of the Hereafter with Allah to the exclusion of mankind, then wish for death if ye say sooth.
And they will by no means ever wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent on before; and Allah is the Knower of the wrong-doers.
And surely thou wilt find them the greediest of men after life, even greedier than those who associate. Each one of them would fain life for a thousand years, and this will not save him from the torment, even if he hath lived so long. And Allah is the Beholder of that which they work.
Say thou: whosoever is an enemy unto Jibril, ----then verily he it is Who hath brought down this Revelation, by Allah's command, to thine heart, confirming that which went before, and a guidance and glad tidings unto the believers.
Whosoever is an enemy unto Allah and His angels and His apostles and Jibril and Mikail, then verily Allah is an enemy unto the infidels.
And assuredly We have sent down Unto thee evident signs, and none shall disbelieve therein save the transgressors.
Is it that whenever they enter into a covenant some party among them cast it aside? Aye! most of them even believe not.
And whenever there came unto them an apostle from Allah confessing to that which was with them, a Party among those who were vouchsafed the Book, cast Allah's Book behind their backs as though they knew not.
And they follow that which the Satans recited in the reign of Sulaiman; and Sulaiman blasphemed not, but the Satans blasphemed.; teaching people magic; and they follow that also which was sent down unto the two angels in Babil, Harut, and Marut. Unto none the twain taught it until they had said: We are but a temptation, so blaspheme not; but they learned from the twain that wherewith they might separate man from his wife; and they could harm none thereby save by Allah's will. And they have learnt that which harmeth them, and profiteth them not; and assuredly they know that whosoever purchaseth it, his is no portion in the Hereafter. And surely vile is the price for which they have bartered themselves, if they but knew!
And had they believed and feared, surely better had been the reward from before Allah, if they but knew!
O O Ye who believe! say not: Ra'ina, but say: Unzurna, and hearken; and unto the infidel shall be a torment afflictive.
Fain would they who disbelieve, be they of the people of the Book or of the associators, that naught of good should be sent down unto you from Your Lord; whereas Allah singleth out for His mercy whomsoever He will and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
Whatsoever verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten We bring a better one or the like thereof; knowest thou not that Allah is over everything Potent?
Knowest thou not that verily Allah! His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth? and for you beside Allah is no protector or helper.
Seek ye to question your apostle, even as Musa was questioned afore. And whosoever changeth belief for infidelity, he hath of a surety strayed from the even way.
Fain would Many of the People of the Book turn you back infidels after ye have believed, out of envy from their, after the truth hath become manifest unto them so Pardon them, and pass over, until Allah sendeth His command. Verily Allah is over everything Potent.
And establish prayer and give the poor-rate. and whatsoever of good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find with Allah; verily Allah is the Beholder of that which ye work.
And they say: none shall enter the Garden except he be a Jew or a Nazarene. Such are their vain desires! Say thou: forthwith your proof if ye say
Aye! whosoever submitteth himself unto Allah and he is a well-doer-his hire is with his Lord; no fear shall come on them nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say: the Nazarenes are not grounded on aught: and the Nazarenes say: the Jews are not grounded on aught While they recite the same Book. Even so say those who know not, the like of their saying. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding that wherein they have been differing.
And who is more unjust than he who preventeth the mosques of Allah, that His name be mentioned therein, and striveth after their ruin? These! it was not for them to enter therein except in fear. Unto them shall be humiliation in this World, and unto them in the Hereafter a torment mighty.
And unto Allah belongeth the east and the west; so withersoever you turn there is the countenance of Allah: verily Allah is pervading, Knowing.
And they Say: God hath betaken unto Him a son! Hallowed be He: Aye unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth: ', all are unto Him devout
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; and whensoever He decreeth an affair, He only saith unto it: be; and it becometh.
And those who know not, say: Wherefore speakest not God unto us? or cometh not unto us a sign? Thus aid those before them the like of their saying: consimilar are their hearts. We have already manifested the signs unto the people who would be convinced.
Verily We have sent thee with the truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and thou shalt not be questioned of the fellows of the Flame.
And the Jews will never be pleased with thee, nor the Nazarenes, except thou follow their faith. Say thou: verily the guidance of Allah, --that is the guidance. And of a surety wert thou to follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of the knowledge, there will be for thee against Allah neither protector nor helper.
Those unto whom We have vouchsafed the Book and they recite it as it ought to be recited - they shall believe therein and whosoever disbelieveth therein, those then! they shall be the losers.
O Children of Isra'il! remember My favour wherewith favoured you, and that I preferred you over the world.
And fear a Day whereon not in aught shall a soul satisfy for a soul, nor shall compensation be accepted therefor, nor shall intercession profit it, nor shall they be succoured.
And recall what time his Lord Proved Ibrahim with certain words then he performed them. He said: verily I am going to make thee a leader unto mankind. Ibrahim said: and also of my progeny? Allah said: My covenant shall not reach the wrong-doers.
And recall what time We appointed the House a resort unto man kind and a place of security and said: take the station of Ibrahim for a place of prayer. And We covenanted with Ibrahim and Ismai'l, saying: purify ye twain My Houses for those who shall circumambulate it and those who shall stay, and those who shall bow down and prostrate themselves.
And recall what time Ibrahim said: my Lord! make this city a place of security, and provide the People thereof with fruits, - such of them as will believe in Allah and the last Day. Allah said: and whosoever will disbelieve, him also shall give enjoyment for a while; thereafter I shall drive him to the torment of the Fire, - an ill abode!
And recall what time Ibrahim was raising the foundation of the House and also Ismai'l, praying: our Lord! accept of us; verily Thou! Thou art the Hearer, the Knower!
Our Lord! make us twain submissive unto Thee, and of our progeny community submissive unto Thee, and show us our rites, and relent toward us! verily Thou! Thou art the Relentant, the Merciful!
Our Lord! raise up unto them an apostle from among them, who shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall teach them the Book and wisdom, and shall cleanse them. Verily Thou! Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
And who shall be averse from the faith of Ibrahim, save one who befooleth his soul! And assuredly We chose him in this World, and verily he in the Hereafter shall be of the righteous.
Recall what time his Lord said unto him: submit, he said: I submit to the Lord of the Worlds.
And Ibrahim enjoined his sons the same and did Ya'qub also, saying: O my sons! verily Allah hath chosen for you the religion, so die not except ye be Muslims.
Were ye witnesses when death presented itself to Ya'qub, what time he said unto his sons: what will ye worship after me! They said: we shall worship the God the God of thy fathers, Ibrahim and Ismai'l and Ishaq, and unto Him we are submissive.
That are a community who have passed away, unto them shall be that which they earned and unto you that which ye earn, and ye shall be questioned not of that which they were wont to Work.
And they say: become Jews or Nazarenes, and ye shall be guided. Say thou: Aye! we follow the faith of Ibrahim, the upright, and he was not of the associators.
Say: we believe in Allah and that which hath been sent down unto us and that which was sent down unto Ibrahim and Ismai'l and Ishaq and Ya'qub and the tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Musa and lsa, and that which was vouchsafed unto the prophets from their Lord; we differentiate not between any of them, and unto Him are submissive.
So if they believe in the like of that which ye believe in, surely they are guided; but if they turn away, then they are but in Cleavage. So Allah will suffice thee against them and He is the Hearer, the Knower.
Ours is the dye of Allah! and who is better at dyeing than Allah! And we are His worshippers.
Say thou: contend ye with us regarding Allah, whereas He is our Lord even as He is Your Lord And unto us our works, and unto you your works, and we are His devotees.
Or say ye that Ibrahim and Ismai'l and Ishaq and Ya'qub, and the tribes were Jews or Nazarenes? Say thou: are ye the more knowing or is Allah? And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony that is with him from Allah? And Allah is not neglectful of that which ye Work.
That are a community who have passed away; unto them shall be that which they earned, and unto you that which ye earn; and ye shall be questioned not of that which they were wont to Work.
Anon will the foolish among mankind say: what hath turned them away from their Qiblah whereon they had been? Say thou: unto Allah belongeth the east and the west he guideth whomsoever He listeth unto a straight path.
And in this wise We have made you a community justly balanced, that ye may be witness against the man kind and that the apostle may be in regard to you a witness. And We appointed not the Qiblah which thou hast had save in order that We might know him who followeth the apostle from him who turnoth back upon his heels. And of a surety the change is grievous save unto those whom Allah hath guided. And Allah is not one to let your faith go wasted; verily Allah is unto mankind Tender, Merciful.
Oft We have seen the turning of thy face to the heaven, wherefore We shall assuredly cause thee to turn towards the Qiblah which shall please thee. Turn then thy face toward the Sacred Mosque; and turn ye, wheresoever ye be, your faces toward it. And verily those who are vouchsafed the Book know this to be the truth and from their Lord. Allah is not neglectful of that which they Work.
And shouldst thou bring unto those who are vouchsafed the Book every sign, they would not follow thy Qiblah, neither art thou to be a follower of their Qiblah; nor doth one part of them follow the Qiblah of the other. And shouldst thou follow their desires, after that which hath come unto thee of the knowledge, then verily thou wilt become one of the wrong-doers.
Those unto whom We have vouchsafed the Book recognise him even as they recognise their children; and verily a party of them hide the truth while they know.
The truth is from thy Lord; be then thou not of the doubters.
For every one is a direction witherward he turnoth; so strive to be foremost in virtues. Wheresoever ye may be, Allah will bring you together. Verily Allah is over everything Potent.
And from whencesoever thou goest forth, turn thy face toward the Sacred Mosque, and verily it is the very truth from thy Lord; and Allah is not neglectful of that which ye work.
And from whencesoever thou goest forth, turn thy face toward the Sacred Mosque, and wheresoever ye be, turn your face toward it, lest there should be with people an argument against you, except those of them who do wrong so fear them not, but fear Me; so that I may accomplish My favour upon you, and that ye may remain guided-
Even as We have sent amidst you an apostle from amongst you, who rehearseth unto you Our revelations and purifieth you, and teacheth you the Book and wisdom, and teacheth you that which ye were not wont to know.
Remember Me wherefore, and I shall remember you: and unto Me give thanks, and be notingrate unto Me.
O O Ye who believe! seek help in patience and prayer; verily Allah is with the patient.
And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah: dead. Nay, they are living, but ye perceive not.
And We will surely prove you with aught of fear and hunger and diminution in riches and lives and fruits; and bear thou the glad tidings unto the patient;
Who, when there afflicteth them an affliction, say: verily we are Allah's, and verily unto Him we are returners.
These! on them shall be benedictions from their Lord and His mercy, and these! they are the rightly guided.
Verily Safa and Marwa are of the landmarks of Allah; so whosoever maketh a pilgrimage to the House, or performeth the Umra, in him there is no fault if he walketh in-between the twain. And whosoever voluntarily doth good, then verily Allah is Appreciative, Knowing.
Verily those who hide that which We have sent down of evidence and the guidance, after We have expounded its Unto mankind in the Book, these! - curseth them Allah, and shall curse them the cursers
Save those that repent and amend, and make manifest the truth I these it is toward whom I relent. And I am the Relenting, the Merciful!
Verily those who disbelieve, and die while they are infidels, these it is on whom shall be the curse of Allah and the angels and mankind all.
They shall be abiders therein, the torment shall not be lightened on them, nor shall they be respited.
And the God of you all is one God; there is no God but he, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
Verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, and the ships that course upon the sea laden with that which profiteth mankind, and that which Allah sendeth down of water from the heaven and quickenoth the earth thereby after the death thereof; and scattereth therein of all kinds of moving creatures, and in the veering of the winds and the cloud subjected for service betwixt heaven and earth. are signs unto a people who understand.
And of mankind are some that set up compeers; unto Allah they love them as with the love due to Allah. And those who believe are strongest in love of Allah. Would that those who do wrong saw, when they saw the torment, that verily power belonged wholly unto Allah, and that Allah was severe in requital -
When those who were followed shall quit themselves of those who followed, and they all shall behold the torment, and sundered between them shall be the Cords.
And those who had followed shall say would that for us were a return, then would we quit ourselves of them as they have quitted themselves of us. In this wise Allah will show them their works as vain regrets; and they shall not be coming forth from the Fire.
Mankind! eat of whatsoever is, the earth, lawful, and clean and follow not the footsteps of Satan; verily he is an enemy unto you manifest.
He only commandeth you to evil and indecency, and that ye should say against Allah that which ye know not
And when it said unto them: follow that which Allah hath sent down, they say: nay, we shall follow that way whereon we found our fathers - even though their fathers understood not aught, nor were they guided aright?
And the likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouteth unto that which heareth naught except a call and a cry; deaf, dumb; blind, wherefore they understand not.
O O Ye who believe! eat of the clean things wherewith We have provided you, and return thanks unto Allah, if Him indeed ye are wont to worship.
He hath only forbidden unto you the carcass and blood and the flesh of swine, and that over which is invoked the name of other than Allah. But whosoever is driven by necessity, neither alusting nor transgressing, for him is no sin; verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Verily those who hide that which Allah hath sent down in the Book and Purchase therewith a small gain, these are they who eat in their bellies naught but Fire. Allah will not speak unto them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them; and unto them shall be a torment afflictive.
These are they who have purchased error for guidance, and torment for forgiveness, How enduring must they be of the Fire!
