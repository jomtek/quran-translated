Ha. Mim.
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
Verily in the heavens and the earth are signs Unto the believers.
And in the creation of yourselves and of the beasts that He hath scattered over the earth, are signs Unto a people who are convinced.
And in the alternation of night and day and that which Allah sendeth down of provision from the heaven and thereby quickeneth the earth after the death thereof and the turning about of the winds, are signs Unto a people who reflect.
These are the revelations of Allah which We rehearse Unto thee with truth: in what discourse then, after Allah and His revelations, will they believe?
Woe Unto every liar, sinner!
Who heareth the revelations of Allah rehearsed Unto him, and yet persisteth with stiff-neckedness as though he heard them not. Announce thou Unto him, then, a torment afflictive.
And when he cometh to know aught of Our revelations, he taketh it scoffingly. These! theirs shall be a torment ignominous;
Before them is Hell; naught will avail them of that which they earned, nor those whom they took for patrons beside Allah. Theirs shall be a torment mighty.
This Book is guidance, and those who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord, theirs shall be torment of calamity, afflictive.
Allah it is Who hath subjected the sea for your sake, that the ships may run thereon by His command and that ye may seek of His grace, and that haply ye may return thanks.
And He hath subjected for your sake whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, the whole from Himself. Verily herein are signs Unto a people who ponder.
Say thou Unto those who believe, let them forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah, that He may requite a community for that which they have been earning.
Whosoever worketh righteously, worketh for himself; and whosoever doth evil, doth against himself; then Unto your Lord ye will be made to return.
And assuredly. We vouchsafed Unto the Children of Israil the Book and the wisdom and the propherhood, and We provided them with good things and preferred them above the worlds.
And We vouchsafed Unto them evidences of the affair. And they differed not except after the knowledge had come Unto them, through spite among themselves. Verily thy Lord will decide between them on the DaY of Judgment concerning that wherein they have been differing.
And thereafter We have placed thee upon the law of the religion; so follow it thou, and follow not the vain desires of those who know not.
Verily they cannot avail thee at all against Allah. And verily the wrong doers! friends are they one Unto another. And Allah is the Friend of the God-fearing.
This Book is an enlightenment Unto mankind and a guidance, and a mercy Unto a People who are convinced.
Deem those who commit ill deeds that We shall make them as those who believe and work righteous Works? Equal is their life and their death! How ill they judge!
And Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with purpose and that every soul may be recompensed for that which it hath earned. And they will not be wronged.
Beholdest thou him who taketh for his god his own vain desire, and Allah hath sent him astray despite his knowledge, and hath sealed up his hearing and his heart, and hath set on his sight a covering? Who will guide him after Allah? Will ye not then be admonished?
And they say: there is no naught but our life of the world; die and we live; and naught destroyeth us save Time. And they have no knowledge thereof: they do but guess.
And when Our manifest revelations are rehearsed Unto them, their argument is no other than that they say bring our fathers, if ye say sooth.
Say thou: Allah keepeth you alive, then He shall cause you to die, then He shall assemble you on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt; but most of mankind know not.
And Allah's is the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and on the Day whereon the Hour arriveth, then shall lose the followers of falsehood.
And thou shalt behold each community kneeling; each community shall be summoned to its Book. Today, shall be recompensed for that which ye have been working.
This Book of Ours speaketh against you with truth; verily We have been setting down whatsoever ye have been working.
Then, as for those who believed and worked righteous works, their Lord will cause them to enter into His mercy: that is a manifest achievement.
And as for those who disbelieved: Were not My revelations rehearsed Unto you? but ye were stiff necked, and ye were a people guilty.
And when it was said; verily Allah's promise is, true, and the Hour! there is no doubt thereof, ye said: we know not what the Hour is, we imagine it naught but an opinion, and we are not convinced.
And there will appear Unto them the evils Of that which they had worked, and there will surround them that whereat they had been mocking.
And it will be said: Today shall forget you, even as ye forgat the meeting of this your Day, and your abode will be the Fire, and none ye will have as helpers.
That is because ye took the revelations of Allah scoffingly, and there beguiled you the life of the world. Today, therefore, they will not be taken forth therefrom, nor will they be suffered to please Allah.
All praise, then, Unto Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds.
And His alone is the Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
