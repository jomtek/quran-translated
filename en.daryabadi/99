When the earth is shaken by the shaking thereof,
And the earth bringeth forth her burthens,
And man saith: what aileth her?
On that Day she will tell out the tidings thereof.
Because thy Lord will inspire her.
On that Day mankind will proceed in bands, that they may be shewn their works.
Then whosoever hath worked good of an atom's weight shall behold it
And whosoever hath worked ill Of an atom's weight shall behold it.
