By the fig, by the olive,
By Mount Sinai,
By the yonder secure city,
Assuredly We have created man in goodliest mould,
Thereafter We cause him to return to the lowest of the low,
Save those who believe and work righteous Works. Theirs shall be hire unending.
What hencefort shall make thee belie the Requital?
Is not Allah the Greatest of the rulers?
