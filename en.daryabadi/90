I swear by yonder city
And thou shalt be allowed in yonder city -
And by the begetter and that which he begat,
Assuredly We have created man in trouble.
Deemest he that none will overpower him?
He saith: 'I have wasted riches plenteous.
Deemest he that none beholdeth him?
Have We not, made for him two eyes
And a tongue and two lips,
And shown Unto him the two highways?
Yet he attempteth not the steep,
And what shall make thee understand that which the steep is?
It is freeing the neck,
Or, feeding, in a day of privation,
An orphan, of kin,
Or a poor man cleaving to the dust.
Then he became of those who believed and enjoined on each other steadfastness and enjoined on each other compassion.
These are the fellows of the righthand.
And those who disbelieve Our signs - they are the fellows of the lefthand.
Over them shall be Fire closing round.
