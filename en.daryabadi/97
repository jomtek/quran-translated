Verily We! We have sent it down on the night of Power.
And what shall make thee know that which the night of Power is?
The night of Power is better than a thousand months.
The angels and the spirit descend therein by the command of their Lord with His decrees for every affair.
It is all peace, until the rising of the dawn.
