The Striking!
What is the Striking?
What shall Make thee know that which the Striking is?
A Day whereon mankind shall become as moths scattered,
And the mountains shall become as wool carded,
Then as for him whose balances are heavy,
He shall be in a lifewell-pleasing.
And as for him whose balances are light,
His dwelling shall be the Abyss.
And what shall make thee know that which she is?
A Fire vehemently hot!
