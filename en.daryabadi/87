Hallow thou the name of thine Lord, the Most High,
Who hath created and then proportioned,
And Who hath disposed and then guided,
And Who bringeth forth the pasturage,
Then maketh it to stubble dusky.
We shall enable thee to recite, and then thou shalt not forget,
Save that which Allah may will. Verily He knoweth the public and that which is hidden.
And We shall make easy Unto thee the easy way.
Wherefore admonish thou; admonition hath surely profited,
Admonished is he indeed who feareth,
And the wretched shunneth it-.
He Who shall roast into the Great Fire,
Wherein he shall neither die nor live,
He indeed hath attained bliss who hath cleansed himself,
And who remembereth the name of his Lord, and then prayeth.
But ye prefer the life of this world,
Whereas the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
Verily this is in Writs ancient
Writs of Ibrahim and Musa.
