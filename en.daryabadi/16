The affair of Allah cometh, so seek not to hasten it. Hallowed be He and Exalted above that which they associate.
He sendeth down the angels with the spirit by His command upon whomsoever of his bondmen He willeth: warn that there is no god but I, wherefore fear Me.
He hath created the heavens and the earth with a purpose. Exalted is He above that which they associate.
He hath created man from a drop, and Lo! he is a disputer open.
And the cattle! He hath created them. For you in them there is warmth and other profits and of them ye eat.
And for you there is beauty in them as ye drive them at eventide and as ye drive them out to pasture.
And they bear Your loads to a city Which ye could not reach except with travail of souls; verily your Lord is Kind, Merciful.
And He hath created horses and mules and asses that ye may ride there on, and as an adornment; and He createth that which ye know not.
And upon Allah is the direction of the way, and thereof is some crooked; and had He willed He would have guided you all.
He it is who sendeth down from the heaven water for you, wherefrom is drinking and wherefrom are trees whereas ye pasture your herds.
He groweth for you thereby the corn and olives and date- palms and grapes and all kinds of fruit. Verily therein is a sign for a people who ponder.
And He hath subiected for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and the stars are subjected by His command. Verily therein are signs for a people who understand.
And He hath subjected for you whatsoever He hath multiplied for you on the earth of various kinds. Verily therein is a sign for a people who receive admonition.
And He it is who hath subjected the sea that ye may eat thereout flesh fresh and bring forth therefrom ornaments that ye wear. And thou beholdest ships ploughing therein, and it is in order that ye may seek of His grace, and that haply ye may give thanks.
And He hath cast on the earth firm mountains lest it move away with you, and rivers and paths that haply ye may be directed.
And also landmarks; and by the stars they are guided.
Is there one who createth like unto one who createth not? Will ye not then be admonished?
And if ye would count the favours of Allah ye could not compute them verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And Allah knoweth that which ye keep secret and that which ye publish.
And those upon whom they call beside Allahls have not created aught, and are themselves created.
Dead are they, not alive; and they perceive not when they will be raised up.
God of you all is One God; so those who believe not in the Hereafter-their hearts are perverse and they are stiff-necked.
Undoubtedly Allah knoweth that which they keep secret and that which they publish; verily He loveth not the stiff- necked.
And when it is said unto them: what is it that your Lord hath sent down? they say: fables of the ancient.
That they may bear their burthens in full on the Judgment- Day and also some of the burthens of those whom they have led astray without knowledge. Lo! vile is that which they shall bear!
Surely there plotted those before them, but Allah came upon their structures from the foundations, so the roof fell down upon them from above them and the torment came upon them whence they perceived not.
Then on the Judgment-Day He will humiliate them and say: where are My associates regarding whom ye have been causing cleavage? Those who have been vouchsafed knowledge will say: verily the humiliation to-day and ill-hap are upon the infidels-
Those whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging them selves, and then they proffer submission: we have not been working any evil. Yea! verily Allah is the Knower of that which ye have been working.
Wherefore enter the portals of Hell as abiders therein. Vile is the abode of the arrogant
And when it is said unto those who fear: what is it that your Lord hath sent down? They say: that which is better. For those who do good is good in this world, and the dwelling of the Hereafter is better. Excellent is the dwelling of the God-fearing!
Gardens Everlasting which they shall enter, whereunder rivers flow; theirs therein shall be whatsoever they list; Thus Allah recompenseth the God-fearing-
Those whom the angels cause to die while they are clean, saying peace be upon you! enter the Garden for that which ye have working.
Await they aught but that the angels should come unto them or the command of thy Lord should come Likewise did those before them. Allah wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong themselves.
Then there be-fell them the vices of that which they had worked, and there surrounded them that whereat they had been mocking.
And those who associate say: had God willed we would not have worshipped aught beside Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor we would have forbidden aught without Him. Like-wise did those before them. Naught is then on the apostles except a preaching plain.
And assuredly We have raised in every community an apostle saying: worship Allah and avoid the devil. Then of them were some whom Allah guided, and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. Wherefore travel about on the earth, and look on what wise hath been the end of the disbelievers.
If thou art solicitous for their guidance, then verily Allah guideth not whomsoever He sendeth astray, and for them there are no helpers.
And they swear by God the most solemn of oaths that God would not raise him who dieth. Yea! it is a promise on Him incumbent but most of mankind know not.
This will be in order that he may manifest unto them that wherein they differ, and that those who disbelieved should come to know that they had been liars.
Our only saying unto a thing, when We intend it, is that We say unto it: be, and it becometh.
And those who have emigrated for the sake of Allah after they had been wronged. We shall surely settle them well in the world and the hire of the Hereafter is greater: if they but know!
They are those who bear with patience, and in their Lord they trust.
And We sent not before thee any but men unto whom We Revealed; so ask ye the people of the Admonition if ye know not.
With evidences and scriptures We sent them. And We have sent down unto thee the Admonition that thou mayest expound unto mankind that which hath been revealed toward them, and that haply they may reflect.
Feel then they secure who have plctted vices that Allah will not sink them into the earth or that the torment may come upon them whence they perceive not?
Or, thathe will not take hold of them in their going to and fro! so that they cannot escape.
Or, that he will not take hold of them by giving them a fright? verily thy Lord is Kind, Merciful.
Have they not observed the things which Allah hath created? shadows thereof turn themselves on the right and on the left. prostrating themselves unto Allah, and they are lowly.
And unto Allah prostrateth itself whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth of the living creatures and also the angels; and they are not stiff-necked.
They fear their Lord above them and do that which they are commanded.
And Allah hath said: take not two gods; He is only One God so Me alone, Me dread.
And His is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and unto Him is obedience due perpetually; will ye then fear any other than Allah?
And whatsoever of favours is with you is from Allah; then when distress toucheth you, unto Him ye cry out.
Then when He removeth the distress from you, forthwith a party of you with their Lord associate.
That they may show ingratitude for that which We have vouchsafed unto them. Enjoy then, presently ye shall know.
And they appoint for that which they knew not a portion of that wherewith We have provided them By Allah! ye will surely be questioned regarding that which ye have been fabricating.
And they appoint for Allah daughters --hallowed be He! -- and for themselves that which they desire.
And when there is announced unto any of them a female his countenance remainoth darkened the whole day and he is wroth inwardly.
Skulking from the people because of the evil of that which hath been announced unto him: shall he keepit with ignominy or bury it in the dust! Lo'. vile is that which they judge!
For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil similitude, and for Allah is the sublime similitude, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
And if Allah were to lay hold of mankind for their wrong- doing, not a living creature He would leave on it, but he deferreth them to a term appointed, then, when their term cometh, they cannot put it off by an hour not anticipate it.
And they ascribe to Allah that which they detest, and their tongues utter the lie that unto them shall be good; undoubtedly unto them shall be the Fire, and they will be hastened thereto.
By Allah! assuredly We have sent apostles to communities before thee, then the Satan made their works fairseeming unto them, so he is their patron to-day, and unto them shall be a torment afflictive.
And We have not sent down the Book unto thee save in order that thou mayest expound unto them that wherein they differ, and as a guidance and a mercy unto a people who believe.
And Allah hath sent down from the heaven water, then he reviveth the earth thereby after the death thereof; verily therein is a sign for a people who hearken.
And verily there is for you in the cattle a lesson: We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, from betwixt the dung and the blood: milk Pure and pleasant to swallow for the drinkers.
And also a lesson for you in the fruits of the date-palms and the grapes whereof ye take a liquor and a provision goodly; verily therein is a sign far a people who understand.
And thy Lord inspired the bee saying: take thou for thyself of the mountains houses and of the trees and of that which they erect.
Then eat thou of all the fruits and tread the ways of thy Lord made easy. There springeth forth from their bellies a drink varied in colours; therein is healing for mankind; verily therein is a sign for a people who reflect.
And Allah hath created you, then He taketh your souls; of you are some who are brought back to the meanest of age, so that they know not aught after having knowledge; verily Allah is Knowing, Potent.
And Allah hath preferred some of you over some other in provision; then those who are preferred are not going to hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess as to be equal in respect thereof. Gainsay they then the favour of Allah?
And Allah hath appointed for yourselves spouses, and from your spouses He hath appointed for you sons and grandsons, and He hath provided you with clean foods. In falsehood then believe they, and in Allah's favour disbelieve they?
And they worship, beside Allah, that which owneth them not any provision from the heavens and the earth, and they cannot
Propound not then for Allah similitudes, verily Allah knoweth and ye know not.
Allah propoundeth a similitude: there is a bondman enslaved who hath not power over aught; and there is one whom We have provided from Ourselves with goodly provision and he expendeth thereof secretly and openly; can they be equal? All praise Unto Allah; but most of them know not.
And Allah propoundeth a similitude: there are two men, one of them dumb who hath of Power over aught and is a weariness unto his master, whithersoever he directeth him he bringeth not any good; is he equal with one who commandeth justice and in himself on a straight patht?
And Allah's is the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and the affair of the Hour will be not but as a flash of the eye, or it is even nearer, verily Allah is over everything Potent.
And Allah hath brought you forth from the bellies of your mothers while ye know not aught, and He hath appointed for you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks.
Behold they not the birds subjected in the firmament of the heaven? Naught supporteth them save Allah; verily therein are signs for people who believe.
Allah hath appointed for you from your houses a repose, and He hath appointed for you from the skins of the cattle houses which ye find light, on the day of your flitting and on the day of your stopping, and from their wools and their furs and their hair a furnishing and an enjoyment for a season.
And Allah hath appointed for you, of that which He hath created shades, and He hath appointed for you from the mountains places of retreat, and He hath appointed for you coats protecting you from the heat and coats protecting you from the violence. Thus He perfecteth His favour on you that haply ye may submit.
Then if they turn away, on thee is only the preaching plain.
They recognize the favour of Allah, then they deny it, and most of them are infidels.
And bewore a Day whereon We will raise up from each community a witness, then those who have disbelieved will not be given leave, nor they will be permitted to please Allah.
And when those who have done wrong will behold the torment, it will not be lightened unto them, nor will they be respited.
And when those who have associated will behold their associate-gods, they will say: our Lord! yonder are our associate-gods upon whom we have been calling beside Thee, they Will proffer them the saying: verily ye are liars.
And they will proffer sub mission unto Allah on that Day, and there will stray from them that which they have been fabricating.
Those who disbelieved and hindered others from the way of Allah- We shall increase for them torment upon torment for they have been spreading corruption.
And beware a Day whereon We shall raise up in every community a witness regarding them from amongst them selves, and We shall bring thee as a witness regarding these. And We, have revealed unto thee the Book as an exposition of everything and as a guidance and mercy and glad tidings to the Muslims.
Verily Allah commandeth justice and well-doing and giving to kindred; and He prohibiteth lewdness and wickedness and oppression; He exhorteth you that haply ye may beadmonished.
And fulfil the covenant of Allahs when ye have covenanted, and violate not the oaths after the ratification thereof, and surely ye have appointed Allah a surety over you. verily Allah knoweth that which ye do:
And be not like unto her who unravelleth her yarn into strands after its strength, holding your oaths a means of discord amongst you that a community may be more numerous than anot her community; Allah only proveth you there by; and He will surely manifest unto you on the Judgment Day that wherein ye have been differing.
And had Allah willed, He would have made you all one community, but he sendeth astray whomsoever He willeth, and guideth whomsoever He willeth; and surely ye shall be questioned regarding that which ye have been working.
And make not your oaths a means of discord amongst you lest a foot may slip after the fixture thereof, and ye may taste evil for having hindered others from the way of Allah, and unto you there shall be a torment mighty.
And barter not the covenant of Allah for a small price; verily that which is with Allah --that is better for you, if ye only know.
That which is with you is exhausted, and that which is with Allah is lasting. And We will surely recompense those who have been patient their hire for the best of that which they have been working
Whosoever worketh righteously, male or female, and is a believer, We will surely quicken him to a clean life, and will surely recompense them their hire for the best of that which they have been working.
And when thou wouldst read the Qur'an seek refuge with Allah from Satan the damned.
Verily he hath no authority over those who believe and in their Lord trust
His authority is only over those who befriend him and those who are in respect of Him associators.
And whenever We change a verse in place of anot her verse - -and Allah is the Best Knower of that wwhich He revealeth --they say: thou art but a fabricator, Aye! most of them know not.
Say thou: the Holy Spirit hath brought it down from thy Lord with truth, that it may establish those who believe, and as a guidance and glad tidings unto the Muslims.
And assuredly We know that they say: it is only a human being who teachech him. The speech of him unto whom they incline is foreign while this is Arabic speech plain.
Verily those who believe not in the signs of Allah--Allah shall not guide them, and unto them shall be a torment afflictive.
It is only those who believe not in the signs of Allah who fabricate lie, and those! they are the liars.
Whosoever disbelieveth in Allah after his belief--save him who is constrained and his heart is at rest with the belief -but whosoever expandeth his breast to infidelity, upon them shall be wrath from Allah, and unto them shall be a torment mighty.
That is because they loved the life of the world above the Hereafter, and because Allah guideth not an infidel people.
These are they upon whose hearts and hearing and sight Allah hath set a seal; and these! they are the negligent.
Undoubtedly they in the Hereafter shall be the very losers.
Then, verily, thy Lord unto those who have emigrated after they had been tempted and have thereafter striven hard and endured, verily thy Lord thereafter is Forgiving, Merciful.
Beware a Day whereon each soul will come pleading for itself, and each soul will be paid in full that which it hath wrought, and they shall not be wronged.
And Allah propoundeth a similitude: a town which was secure and at rest, to which came the provision thereof plenteously from every place; then it ungratefully denied the favours of Allah; wherefore Allah made it taste the extreme of hunger and fear because of that which they were wont to perform.
And assuredly there came to them an apostle from among them, but they belied him, wherefore the torment took hold of them while yet they were wrong-doers.
So eat of that which Allah hath provided you of lawful and clean things, and give thanks for Allah's favour, if it is He whom ye are went to Worship.
He hath only disallowed unto you the dead-meat and blood and swine-flesh and that over which is invoked the name of other than Allah. Then whosoever is driven by necessity, not alusting nor transgressing verily Allah Is Forgiving, Merciful.
And say not concerning that wherein Your togues utter a lie: this is lawful, and this is unlawful, that ye may fabricate a lie againt Allah, verily those who fabricate lie against Allah shall not fare well.
A brief enioyment, and unto them shall be a torment afflictive.
And un to those who are Judaised We disallowed that which We have already recounted unto thee; and We wronged them not, but themselves they were wont to Wrong.
Then, verily, thy Lord unto those who work evil from ignorance, and then repent thereafter and amend, verily thy Lord thereafter is Forgiving, Merciful.
Verily Ibrahim was a pattern, devout unto Allah, upright, and, not of the associaters.
Grateful for His favours: He chose him and guided him to a straight path.
And We vouchsafed unto him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous.
Afterwards We revealed unto thee: follow thou the faith of Ibrahim the upright; and he was not of the associaters.
The sabbath was only appointed for those who differed thereon; and verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Judgment-Day concerning that wherein they have been differing.
Call them unto the way of thy Lord with Wisdom and goodly exhortation, and argue with them with that which is best. Verily thy Lord! He is the Best Knower of him who hath strayed from His way, and He is the Best Knower of the guided ones.
And if ye chastise, then chastise with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted, and if ye endure patiently, then surely it is better for the patient.
And endure them patiently; and thy patience is not but from Allah; and grieve not over them, and be not thou in straitness because of that which they plot.
Verily Allah is with those who fear and those who are well- doers.
