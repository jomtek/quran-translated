Alif. Lam Mim.
Revelation of this Book, whereof there is no doubt, is from the Lord of the Worlds.
Will they say: he hath fabricated it? Aye! it is the truth from thy Lord, that thou mayest warn therewith a people unto whom no warner came before thee, that haply they may be guided.
Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is betwixt the twain in six days, and then He established Himself on the throne. No patron have ye nor an intercessor, besides Him. Will ye not then be admonished?
He disposeth every affair from the heaven unto the earth; thereafter it shall ascend unto Him in a Day the measure whereof is one thousand years of that which ye compute.
Such is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Merciful.
Who hath made everything exceeding good which He hath created. And He originated the creation of man from clay;
Then He made his progeny from an extract of water base.
Then He fashioned him and breathed into him something of a spirit from Him; and He ordained for you hearing and sight and hearts. Little is the thanks ye return.
And they say: when we are vanished in the earth, shall we then be raised in a new creation? Aye! in the meeting with their Lord they are disbelieving.
Say thou: the angel of death who is set over you shall cause you to die, thereafter unto your Lord ye shall be returned.
Couldst thou but see when the culprits shall hang their heads before their Lord, saying: our Lord! we have now seen and heard; so send us back; we shall work righteously, verily we are convinced.
And had We listed surely We could have given every soul its guidance; but true must be the word from Me; I shall surely fill Hell with the Jinn and mankind together.
So taste ye the sequel, for as much as ye forgat the meeting of this your day, verily We have forgotten you. Taste the torment abiding for that which ye have been working.
They alone believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded thereof, fall down prostrate and hallow the praise of their Lord, and they are not stiff-necked.
Their sides leave off the couches calling upon their Lord in fear and in desire, and of that wherewith We have provided them they expend.
No soul knoweth that which is kept hidden for them of perfect comfort as a recompense for that which they have been working.
Shall he, therefore, who is a believer, be like unto him who is a transgressor? They are not equal.
And as for those who believe and work rigteous works--for them are Gardens of Abode: an entertainment for that which they have been working.
And as for those who transgress their abode is the Fire. So oft as they desire to get thereout, they shall be sent back thereto; and it will be said unto them: taste the torment of the Fire which ye were wont to belie.
And surely We shall make them taste of the smaller torment prior to the greater torment, that haply they may yet return.
And who is a greater wrong-doer than he who is reminded of His signs, then he turneth aside therefrom? Verily unto the culprits We are going to be Avenger.
Assuredly We vouchsafed the Book Unto Musa; so be thou not in doubt in thy receiving it. And We appointed it to be a guidance unto the Children of Is'rail.
And We appointed, from amongst them, leaders guiding others by Our command, when they had persevered, and of Our signs they were convinced.
Verily thy Lord! He shall decide between them on the Day of Judgment concerning that wherein they have been differing.
Hath this not guided them: how many generations We have destroyed before them amidst whose dwellings they walk? Verily therein are signs; will they not therefore hearken?
Observe they not that We drive water unto a land bare, and bring forth therewith crops whereof their cattle and they themselves eat? Will they not therefore be enlightened?
And they say: When will this Decision arrive if ye are truthtellers?
Say thou: on the day of the Decision their belief will not profit those who have disbelieved; nor will they be respited.
Wherefore turn aside thou from them, and await; verily they are awaiting.
