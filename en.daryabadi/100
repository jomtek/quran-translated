By the chargers panting,
And striking off fire by dashing their hoofs.
And raiding at dawn
And therein raising dust.
And cleaving their way therein into the host,
Verily man is Unto his Lord ungrateful.
And verily to that he is witness.
And verily in the love of wealth he is vehement,
Knoweth he not - when that which is in the graves, shall be ransacked?
And there shall be brounht to light that which is in the breasts?
Verily their Lord on that Day will be of them Aware.
