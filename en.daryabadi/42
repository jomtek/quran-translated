Ain. Sin. Qaf.
In this wise revealeth Unto thee and Unto those before thee, Allah the Mighty, the Wise.
His is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and He is the Exalted, the Grand.
Well-nigh the heavens might be rent in sunder from above them. And the angels hallow the praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for these on the earth. Lo! Verily Allah! He is the Forgiver, the Merciful!
And those who take Patrons beside Him, Allah is Warden over them, and thou art not over them a trustee.
And thus We have revealed Unto thee a Qur'an in Arabic, that thou mayest warn the mother of towns and those around it, and that thou mayest warn them of a Day of Assembling whereof there is no doubt. A party will be in the Garden, and a party in the Blaze.
And had Allah willed, He would have made them one community; but He causeth whomsoever He will to enter into His mercy. And the wrong doers! for them there shall be no patron or helper.
Have they taken patrons besides Him! But Allah! He is the Patron, HE quickeneth the dead, and He is over every-thing Potent.
And whatsoever it be wherein ye differ the decision thereof is with Allah; such is Allah, my Lord: in Him put my trust and Unto Him I turn in penitenance.
The Creator of the heavens and the earth: He hath made for you mates of yourselves, and of the cattle also mates, whereby He diffuseth you. Not like Unto Him is aught, and He is the Hearer, the Beholder!
His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He expandeth provision for whomsoever He will and stinteth. Verily; He is of everything the Knower.
He hath instituted for you in religion that which He had enjoined upon Nuh, and which We have revealed Unto thee, and which We had enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa, saying: establish the religion, and be not divided therein. Grievous Unto the associaters is that Unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth for Himself whomsoever He will and guideth Unto Himself whomsoever turneth in penitence.
And they divided not until after knowledge had come to them, through spite between themselves; And had not a word gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, the affair would surely have been judged between them. And verily those who have been made inheritors of the Book after them are in doubt thereof dubitating.
Wherefore Unto that summon thou, and be steadfast as thou hast been commanded, and follow not their desires. And say thou: I believe in whatsoever Allah hath sent down of the Book, and I am commanded that I should do justice between you; Allah is our Lord and your Lord; Unto us our works, and Unto you your works; let there be no contention between us and you; Allah will assemble us, and Unto Him is the return.
And those who contend respecting the religion of Allah after it hath been acknowledged, their contention is void in the sight of their Lord, and upon them shall befall wrath, and theirs shall be a severe torment.
Allah it is Who hath sent down the Book with the truth and the balance. And what shall make thee know the Hour may haply be nigh.
Only those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, and those who believe are fearful thereof and know that it is the truth. Lo! verily these who debate concerning the Hour are in error far-off.
Allah is Gentle Unto His bondmen: He provideth for whomsoever He will, and He is the Strong, the Mighty.
Whosoever seeketh the tillage of the Hereafter Unto him We shall give increase in his tillage; and whosoever seeketh the tillage of the world We shall give him somewhat thereof, and in the Hereafter his shall be no portion.
Have they associate-gods who have instituted for them a religion which Allah hath not allowed? And had there net been a decisive Word, the affair would have been judged between them. And verily the wrong-doers? theirs shall be a torment afflictive.
Thou shalt see the wrong-doers fearful on account of that which they have earned, and it is sure to befall them. And those who believe and work righteous works will be in meadows of the Gardens theirs will be whatsoever they list, in the presence of their Lord. That! that is the supreme grace.
That is that whereof Allah giveth the glad tidings Unto His bondmen who believe and work righteous works, Say thou: I ask of you no hire therefor save affection in respect of kinship. And whoso ever earneth a good deed We shall increase Unto him good in respect thereof; verily Allah is Forgiving, Appreciative.
Say they: he hath fabricated a lie concerning God! Now, if Allah willed, He would seal thine heart. And Allah abolisheth falsehood and establisheth truth by His words; verily He is the Knower of that which is in the breasts.
And He it is Who accepteth repentances from His bondmen, and pardoneth the evil deeds and knoweth that which ye do.
And He answereth those who believe and work righteous works and increaseth Unto them of His grace. And the infidels! theirs shall be a severe torment.
And had Allah expanded the provision for His bondmen they surely would have rebelled in the earth, but He sendeth down by measure as He willeth; verily He is, in respect of His bondmen. Aware and Beholder.
And He it is Who sendeth down the rain after men have despaired, and spreadeth abroad His mercy. And He is the Patron of all, the Praiseworthy.
And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and of the moving creatures which He hath dispersed in the twain. And He is for their assembling whensoever He will Potent.
And whatsoever of affliction befalleth you is owing to that which your hands have earned; and He pardoneth much.
And ye cannot frustrate His Punishment in the earth; and there is for you beside Allah neither protector nor helper.
And of His signs are the ships in the sea like landmarks.
If He willeth He causeth the wind to cease so that they keep still on the back thereof; verily therein are signs for every patient, grateful person.
Or He may destroy them because of that which they have earned, and He may pardon many of them.
And those who dispute in respect of Our revelations may know that for them there is a place of shelter.
So whatsoever things are vouchsafed Unto you are but a Passing enjoyment for the life of the world, and that which is with Allah, better and more lasting, is for those who believe and in their Lord put their trust.
And those who avoid heinous sins and indecencies, and when they are wroth forgive.
And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish prayer and whose affair being matter of counsel among themselves, and who of that wherewith We have provided them expend.
And those who, when they are oppressed vindicate themselves.
The meed of an ill-deed is an ill the like thereUnto; but whosoever pardoneth and amendeth, his hire is on Allah; verily He approveth not the wrong-doers.
And whosoever vindicateth him self after wrong done him these! against them there is no way of blame.
The way of blame is only against those who wrong mankind, and rebel in the earth without justice; these! for them is a torment afflictive.
And whosoever forbeareth and forgiveth -that verily is of the firmness of affairs.
And whomsoever Allah will send astray, for him there will be no protecting friend to take His place. And thou wilt behold the wrong- doers when they behold the torment saying: is there Unto return any way?
And thou wilt behold them set up before it, downcast with ingominy ond looking with stealthy glance. And those who believe will say: verily the losers are they who have lost themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! verily the wrong-doers will be in a a torment lasting.
And they shall have no patrons succouring them beside Allah. And whomsoever Allah sendeth astray for him there will be no way.
Answer the call of Your Lord afore there cometh Unto you a Day for which there is no averting from Allah. Ye will have no place of refuge on that Day, nor there will be for you any denying of Your guilt.
If then they turn away, then We have not sent thee to be a warden over them, on thee is naught but preaching. And verily We! when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us he exulteth thereat; and if an ill befalleth them because of that which their hands have sent on, then verily man becometh ingrate.
Allah's is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He createth whatsoever He Will. He bestoweth females upon whomsoever He will, and bestoweth males upon whomsoever He Will.
Or He conjoineth them males and females; and He maketh barren whomsoever He will; verily He is Knower, Petent.
And it is not Possible for a human being that Allah should speak Unto him otherwise than by revelation or from behind a veil, or that He sendeth a messenger, so that he revealeth by His command whatsoever He will; verily He is Exalted, Wise.
Even so We have revealed Unto thee a spirit of Our command; thou knewest not whatsoever the Book was, nor whatsoever the faith; We have made it a light wherewith We guide whomsoever We will of Our bondmen. And verily thou guidest Unto a straight path.
The path of Allah, Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Lo! Unto Allah trend all affairs.
