Woe Unto the scrimpers:
Those who, when they take by measure from mankind, exact the full,
And who, when they measure Unto them or weigh for them, diminish.
Imagine such men not that they shall be raised up?
On a mighty Day.
A Day whereon mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds?
By no means! Verily the record of the ungodly is in Sijjin.
And what will make thee know whatsoever the record in Sijjin is?
A record of misdeeds written.
Woe on that Day unto the belviers-
Those who belie the Day of Requital.
And none belieth it save each trespasser, sinner.
And when Our revelations are rehearsed Unto him, she saith:'fables of the ancients!
By no means!' Aye! encrusted upon their hearts is that which they have been earning.
By no means! Verily on that Day from their Lord they will be shut Out.
Then verily they will be roasted into the Scorch.
Then it will be said: 'this is that which ye were wont to belie.'
By no means! Verily the record of the virtuous shall be in 'Illiyun.
And what will make thee know whatsoever the record in Illiyun is?
A record of good deeds written.
To which bear witness those brought nigh.
Verily the virtuous shall be in Delight,
Reclining on couches, looking on.
Thou wilt recognize in their faces the brightness of delight.
They will be given to drink of pure wine, sealed.
The seal thereof will be of musk and to this end let the aspirers aspire -
And admixture thereof will be Water of Tasnim:
A fountain whereof will drink those brought nigh.
Veriiy those who have sinned were wont at those who had believed to laugh,
And, when they passed them, to wink at each other,
And when they returned to their household they returned jesting.
And when they saw them, they said: verily these are the strayed ones.
Whereas they were not sent over them as watchers.
Wherefore Today, those who believed at the infidels are laughing,
Reclining on couches, looking on.
The infidels have indeed been rewarded for that which they had been doing.
