This is a chapter which We have sent down, and which We have ordained; and therein We have sent down revelations manifest, that haply ye may be admonished.
The adulteress and the adulterer: scourge each one of the twain with a hundred stripes. And let not tenderness rake hold of you in regarad to the twain in the law of Allah, if ye have come to believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let witness this torment a band of the believers.
The adulterer weddeth not but an adulteress or an associatoress: and the adulteress! --none weddeth her save an adulterer or an associator; and that is forbidden unto the believers.
And those who accuse clean wowomen and then bring not four eyewitnesses, Scourge them with eighty stripes and accept not their- testimony for Ever. And these! they are the transgressors
Excepting those who thereafter shall repent and make amends. Verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And as for those who accuse their wives and there are not for them witnesses except themselves, the testimony of one of them shall be four testimonies by Allah: that verily he is of the truth-tellers
And the fifth, that the curse of Allah be upon him if he be of the liars.
And it will revert the chastisement from her if she testifieth by Allah four times that verily he is of the liars.
And the fifth that Allah's wrath be upon her if he is of the truthtellers.
And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you and that Allah is Relenting, Wise, ye had been lost.
Verily those who brought forward the calumny were a small band among Deem it not an evil for you; nay, it was good for you. Unto every one of them shall be that which he hath earned of the sin, and he among them who undertook the bulk of it---for him shall be a torment mighty.
Wherefore, when ye heard it, did not the believing men and believing women imagine best of their own people and say: this is a calumny manifest!
Wherefore did they not bring four witnesses thereof? Then when they brought not the witnesses, those! with Allah they are the liars.
Had there not been Allah's grace upon you and His mercy in the World and the Hereafter, surely there would have touched you for that whcrein ye had rushed, torment mighty--
When ye were publishing it with your tongues and saying that with your mouths of which ye had no knowledge. Ye deemed it light, and it was with Allah mighty!
And wherefore, when ye heard it, did ye not say: it is not for us to speak thereof, hallowed be Thou! that is a slander mighty!
Allah exhorteth you lest ye may ever revert to the like thereof, if ye are believers indeed.
And Allah expoundeth unto you the revelations and Allah is Knowing, wise.
Verily those who love that in decency should be propagated regarding those who believe, for them shall be a torment afflictive in the world and the Hereafter. And Allah knoweth, and ye know not.
And had there not been Allah's grace upon you and His mercy, and that Allah was Tender and Merciful, ye had Perished.
O Ye who believe! follow not the footsteps of the Satan. And whosoever followeth the footsteps of the Satan, then he only urgeth to indecency and abomination. And had there not been the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been cleansed; but Allah cleanseth whomsoever He Will and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And let not the owners of affluence and amplitude among you swear off from giving unto the kindred and the needy and the emigrants in the way of Allah; let them pardon and overlook. Love ye not that Allah should forgive you And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
verily those who accuse chaste. unknowing, - believing women, shall be cursed in the world and the Hereafter; and for them shall be a torment mighty.
On the Day whereon their tongues and their hands and their feet will bear witness against them regarding that which they were wont to work.
On that Day Allah shall pay them in full their recompense, and they shall know that Allah! He is the True, the Manifest.
Vile women are for vile men, and vile men are for vile women, and clean women are for Clean men, and clean men are for clean women; these are quit of that which the people say: for them is forgiveness and a provision honoured.
O Ye who believe! enter not houses other than your own until ye have asked leave and invoked peace on the inmates thereof. That is better for you, haply ye may take heed.
Then if ye find no one therein, enter not until leave hath been given you. And if it iaid unto you go back, then go back. It is Cleaner for you, and Allah is of that which ye work knower.
No fault it is upon you that ye enter houses uninhabited wherein there is some property for you; and Allah knoweth that which you disclose and that which ye hide.
Say thou unto the believers that they shall lower their sights and guard their private parts, that is cleaner for them; verlly Allah is Aware of that which they perform.
And say thou unto the believing women that they shall lower their sights and guard their private parts and shall not disclose their adornment except that which appeareth thereof; and they shall draw their scarves over their bosoms; and shall not disclose their adornment except unto their husbands or their fathers or their husbands fathers or their sons or their husbands sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their Women or those whom their right hands own or male followers wanting in sex desire or children not acquainted with the privy parts of women; and they Shall not strike their feet so that there be known that which they hide of their adornment. And turn penitently unto Allah ye all, O ye believers, haply ye may thrive!
And wed the single among you and the fit ones among your male and female slaves; if they are poor, Allah will enrich them of His grace; Allah is Ample, Knowing.
And those who find not means to marry shall restrain themselves until Allah enricheth them of His grace. And from among those whom your right hands own those who seek a writing- write it for them if ye know in them any good, and vouchsafe unto them of the wealth of Allah which He hath vouchsafed unto you. And constrain not your bedmaids to harlotry if they would live chastely, in order that ye may seek the chance gain of the life of the world. And whosoever will constrain them, then verily Allah is--after their constraint--Forgiving, Mercifu1.
And assuredly We have sent down unto you revelations illuminating and a similitude for those who passed away before you and an exhortation unto the God-fearing.
Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth: the likeness of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp; the lamp is in glass; the glass is as though it were a star brilliant; lit from a tree blest, an olive, neither in the east nor in the west; well-nigh its oil would glow forth even though fire touch it not. light upon light. Allah guideth unto His light whomsoever He will: And Allah propoundeth similitudes for mankind: verily Allah is of everything the Knower.
They worship in houses which Allah has bidden to be exalted and His name to be remembered therein; they hallow Him therein in mornings and evenings-
Men whom neither trafficking nor bargaining diverteth from the remembrance of Allah and the establishment of the prayer and the giving of the poor-rate, fearing a Day whereon upset will be the hearts and sights.
That Allah may recompense them the best for that which they worked and may increase unto them of His grace, and Allah provideth for whomsoever He will without measure.
And those who disbelieve--their works are like a mirage in a desert which the thirsty deemeth to be water, until when he cometh thereto he findeth not aught, and findeth Allahs with himself, and He payeth him his account in full; and Allah is swift at reckoning.
Or, like the darknesses in a sea deep; there covereth it a wave from above it, a wave from above it, above which is a cloud: darknesses one above anot her: when he putteth out his hand well-nigh he seeth it not. And upto whomsoever Allah shall not appoint a light, his shall be no light.
Beholdest thou not that Allah --those hallow Him whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and the birds with wings outspread? Surely each one knoweth his prayer and his hallowing; and Allah is the Knower of that which they do.
And Allah's is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah is the return.
Beholdest thou not that Allah driveth a cloud along, then combineth it, then maketh it a heap, and then thou beholdest the fine rain come forth from the interstices thereof? And He sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail, then afflicteth therewith whomsoever He will, and averteth it from whomsoever He will: wellnigh the flash of His lightening taketh away the sights.
Allah turneth the night and the day over and over; verily therein is a lesson for men of insight.
Allah hath created every moving creature of water; of them is one that walketh upon his belly. and of them is one that walketh upon its two feet; and of them is one that walketh upon four. Allah createth whatsoever He listeth; verily Allah is over everything Potent.
Assuredly We have sent down revelations illuminating: and Allah guideth whomsoever He listeth unto a path straight.
And they say: we have believed in Allah and in the apostle and we have obeyed; then there backslide a party of them thereafter: and these are not believers.
And when they are called to Allah and His apostle that he may judge between them, lo! a party of them are averters.
And if right had been theirs, they would have come to him readily.
Is in their hearts a disease? or doubt they? or fear they that Allah shall misjudge them, as also His apostle? Aye! these are the very wrong-doers!
-The only saying of the believers when they were called to Allah and His apostle thathe might judge between them was that they said: We hear and we obey. And these! they are the very ones blissful.
And whosoever obeyeth Allah and His apostle, and dreadeth Allah and feareth him-these! they are the achievers.
And they swear by Allah with their solemn oaths that, if thou commandest them they will surely go forth. Say thou: swear not, obedience is recognize! verily Allah is Aware of that which ye Work.
Say thou: obey Allah and obey the apostle; then if ye turn away, upon him is only that wherewith he hath been laid upon, and upon you is that wherewith ye have been laid upon; if ye obey him, ye will be guided; and naught is upon the apostle except the preaching plain.
Allah hath promised those of you who believe and work the righteous works that he shall make them successors on the earth even as He had made those before them successors, and that he shall surely establish for them their religion which He hath approved for them, and that he shall surely exchange unto them after their fear a security, provided they worship Me, associating not aught with Me; and whosoever will disbelieve thereafter, then those! they are the transgressors.
And establish the prayer and give the poor-rate and obey the apostle, haply ye may be shewn mercy.
Deem not those who disbelieve able to frustrate His Purpose on the earth; and their abode shall be the Fire--an ill retreat!
O Ye who believe! let those whom your right hands own and those of you who have not attained puberty ask leave of you three times before the dawn prayer, and when ye lay aside your garments noonday, and after the night-prayer: three at times of privacy for you. NO fault there is upon you or upon them beyond these times going round upon you, some of you upon some others. In this wise Allah expoundeth unto you the commandments; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And when the children among you attain puberty, then let them ask leave even as those before them asked leave. In this wise Allah expoundeth unto you His commandments; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And past child-bearing women who have no hope of wedlock-- upon them it is no fault that they lay aside their outer garments, not flaunting their adornment. And that they should restrain themselves is better for them; Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
No restriction is there upon the blind, nor is there the restriction upon a lame, nor is there a restriction upon the sick. nor upon yourselves that ye eat in your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your fathers brothers or the houses of your fathers sisters or the houses of your mothers brothers or the houses of your mothers sisters or from that house where of ye own the keys or from the house of a friend. No fault is there upon you whether ye eat together or in separate groups, Then when ye enter houses, salute each other with a greeting from before Allah, blest and goodly. Thus Allah expoundeth unto you the revelations, haply ye may reflect.
The believers are those alone who have believed in Allah and His apostle, and when they are with him on some affair collecting People together they depart not Until they have asked his leave. Verily those who ask thy leave, those are they who believe in Allah and His apostle. So if they ask thy leave for some business of theirs, give thou leave unto whomsoever of them thou wilt, and ask thou forgiveness of Allah for them. Verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Place not the apostle's calling among you on the same footing as your calling of each other. Of a surety Allah knoweth those who slip away privately; let therefore those who oppose His commandment beware lest there befall them a trial or there befall them a torment afflictive.
Lo! verily Allah's is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth; surely He knoweth that which ye are about and the Day whereon they shall be made to return unto Him; then He shall declare unto them that which they worked; and Allah is of everything the Knower.
