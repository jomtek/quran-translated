By the night when it envelopeth,
By the day when it appeareth in glory,
By Him Who hath created the male and the female,
Verily your endeavour is diverse.
Then as for him who giveths and feareth Him.
And testifieth to the Good,
Unto him therefore We shall indeed make easy the path to ease.
And as for him who stinteth and is heedless,
And who belieth the Good,
Unto him therefore We shall Indeed make easy the path to hardship.
And his substance will avail him not when he perisheth.
Verify on us is the guidance
And verify Ours is both the Hereafter and the life present.
Wherefore have warned you of Fire flaming,
None shall roast therein but the most wretched,
Who belieth and turneth away.
And avoid it shall the most pious,
Who giveth away his substance that he may be cleansed,
And who hath no favour from anyone to recompense.
But only seeking the Countenance of his Lord the Most High.
And presently he shall become wellpleased.
