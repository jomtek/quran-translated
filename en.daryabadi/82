When the heaven shall be cleft,
And when the stars shall be scattered,
And when the seas are flowed out,
And when the graves are ransacked,
Each soul shall know that which it sent afore and that which it left behind.
O man! what hath beguiled thee concerning thy Lord, the Bountiful,
Who created thee, then moulded thee, then proportioned thee?
In whatsoever form He listed He constructed thee.
By no means! Aye, ye belie the the Requital.
Verify there are for you guardians,
Honourablel scribes.
They know whatsoever ye do.
Verily the pious shall be in Delight.
And verily the ungodly shall be in a Scorch.
Roasted they shall be therein on the Day of Requital.
And thence they shall not be allowed to be absent.
And what shall make thee know whatsoever the Day of Requital is?
Again, what shall make thee know whatsoever the Day of Requital is?
It is a Day whereon no soul shall own aught of power for any soul; and the command on that Day will be Allah's.
