He frowned and turned away.
Because there came Unto him a blind man.
How canst thou know, whether haply he might be cleansed,
Or be admonished, so that the admonition might have profited him?
As for him who regardeth himself self-sufficient-
Unto him thou attendest.
Whereas it is not on thee that he is not cleansed.
And as for him who cometh Unto thee running,
And he feareth'-
Him thou neglectest!
By no means! Verily it is an admonition.
So whosoever willeth-let him be admonished therewlth.
Inscribed in Writs honoured,"
Exalted, Purified,
By the hands of scribes.
Honourable and virtuous.
Perish man! how ungrateful he is!
Of what thing hath He created him?
Of a drop of seed. He created him and formed him according to a measure.
Then the way He made easy.
Then He caused him to die and made him to be buried.
Then when He listeth, He shall raise him to life.
By no means He performed not that which He had commanded him.
Let man look at his food:
It is We Who pour forth water, pouring,
Thereafter We cleave the earth in clefts,
Then We cause therein the grain to grow,
And grapes and vegetables
And olives and palms
And enclosed gardens luxuriant.
And fruits and herbage:
A provision for you and for your cattle.
Then when cometh the Deafening Cry-
On the Day whereon a man shall flee from his brother,
And his mother and his father,
And his wife and his sons;
For every one of them on that Day shall be business enough to occupy
Faces on that Day shall be beaming,
Laughing, rejoicing.
And faces on that Day! upon them shall be gloom.
Dust shall cover them
Those! they are the infidels, the ungodly.
