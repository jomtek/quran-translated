O ye who believe! take not Mine enemy and your enemy for friends, showing affection toward them, whilst they of a surety disbelieve in that which hath come Unto you of the truth, and have driven forth the apostle and yourselves because ye believe in Allah, your Lord, if ye have come forth to strive in My way and to seek My goodwill. Ye secretly show them affection, while I am best Knower of that which ye conceal and that which ya make known! And whosoever of you doth this, he hath surely strayed from the straight path.
Should they come upon you, they will be enemies Unto you and will stretch out against you their hands and their tongues with evil; and fain would they that ye should disbelieve.
There will profit you neither your kindred nor your children on the Day of Resurrection. He shall decide between; and Allah is of that which ye you work Beholder.
Surely there hath been an excellent pattern for you in Ibrahim and those with him, when they said Unto their people; verily we are quit of you and of that which ye worship beside Allah; we renounce you; and surely there hath appeared between us and you hostility and hatred for evermore until ye believe in Allah alone, - except the saying of Ibrahim Unto his father: surely I shall beg forgiveness for thee, and I have no power with Allah for thee at all. Our Lord! in Thee we put our trust, and Unto Thee we turn, and Unto Thee is the journeying.
Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord! verily Thou! Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
Assuredly there hath been in them for you an excellent pattern-for him who hopeth for Allah and the last Day. And whosoever turneth away, then verily Allah! He is the Self-sufficient, the Praiseworthy.
Belike Allah may appoint between you and those of them whom ye hold as enemies affection. And Allah is Potent, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah forbiddeth you not that ye should deal benevolently and equitably with those who fought not against you on accouct of religion nor drave you out from your homes; verily Allah loveth the equitable,
Allah only forbiddeth you with regard to those who fought against you on account of religion and drave you out from your homes and helped in driving you out, that ye should befriend them. And whosoever shall befriend them, then those! they are the wrong-doers.
O ye who believe! when believing women come Unto you as emigrants examine them. Allah is the best Knower of their faith. Then if ye know them to be true believers, send them not back Unto the infidels; they are not lawful Unto them, nor are they lawful Unto them. And give them that which they have expended. Nor is it any crime in you if ye marry them when ye have given their hires. And hold not to the ties of the infidel women, and ask back that which ye have expended, and let them ask back that which they have expended. That is the judgment of Allah; He judgeth between you, And Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And if any of your wives hath been left with the infidels, and then ye have retaliated, then give Unto those whose wives have gone away the like of that which they have expended, and fear Allah in whom ye are believers.
O Prophet! when believing women come Unto thee swearing fealty Unto thee, that they shall not associate aught with Allah, nor they shall steal, nor they shall commit fornication, nor they shall slay their children, nor they shall produce any falsehood that they have fabricated between their hands and feet, nor they shall disobey thee in anything reputable, then accept thou their fealty, and pray to Allah for their forgiveness. Verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O ye who believe! befriend not a people against whom Allah is Wroth. Surely they have despaired of tHe Hereafter even as have despaired the entombed of the infidels. S
