Recite thou in the name of thy Lord Who hath created -
Hath created man from a clot!
Recite thou: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous,
Who hath taught mankind by the pen -
Hath taught man that which he knew not.
By no means: Verily man exorbitateth.
As he bethinkest himself selfsufficient.
Verily Unto thy Lord is the return.
Bethinkest thou him who forbiddeth,
A bondman of Ours when he prayeth *
Bethinkest thou, if he is himself guided,
Or he commandeth piety?
Bethinkest thou, if he belieth and turneth away?
Knoweth he not that Allah beholdeth?
By no means! If he desist not We shall seize and deal him by the forelock -
A forelock, lying, sinning.
Then, let him call his assembly,
We also shall call the infernal guards.
By no means! Obey not thou him. Continue to adore, and continue to draw nigh.
