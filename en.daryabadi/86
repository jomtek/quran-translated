By the heaven and the night-comer
And what shall make thee know that which the night-comer is?-
It is the star shing brightly.
No soul is there but hath over it a watcher.
So let man look - from what is he created.
He is created from a water drip-ping,
That issueth from between the loins and the breast-bones.
Verily He is Able to restore him,
On a Day whereon secrets shall be out.
Then he shall have no power nor any helper.
By the heaven which returneth,
And by the earth which splitteth,
Verily, it is a discourse distinguishing.
And it is not a frivolity.
Verily they are plotting a plot.
And I am plotting a plot.
So respite thou the infidels - respite them gently,
