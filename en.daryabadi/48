Verily We! a victory We have given thee, a manifest victory.
That Allah may forgive thee that which hath preceded of thy fault and that which may come later, and may accomplish the more His favour on thee, and may keep thee guided on the straight path.
And that Allah may succour thee with a mighty succour.
He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they might increase belief Unto their belief. And Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth and Allah is ever Knowing, Wise.
He hath ordained war in order that He may cause the believing men and the believing women enter Gardens whereunder rivers flow, as abiders therein, and that He may expiate from them their misdeeds. And that is with Allah ever an achievement mighty.
And that He may chastise the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the associaters and the associatresses, the thinkers of evil thought concerning Allah. Unto them shall befell the evil turn of fortune, and Allah shall be wroth with them and shall curse them, and He hath gotten ready for them Hell: an ill destination!
And Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.
Verily We! We have sent thee as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.
That ye may believe in Allah and His apostle, and may assist Him and honour Him, and may hallow Him at dawn and evening.
Verily those who swear fealty Unto thee, only swear fealty Unto Allah: the hand of Allah is over their hands. So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt; and whosoever fulfilleth that which he hath convenanted with Allah, him anon He shall give a mighty hire.
Those who lagged behind of the desert Arabs Will presently say Unto thee: our properties and our households kept us occupied, so ask thou forgiveness for Us. They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say thou: who can avail you in aught against Allah, if He intended you hurt or intended you benefit? Yea! Allah is of that which ye work ever Aware.
Yea! ye imagined that the apostle and the believers would never return to their households, and that became fair-seeming in your hearts, and ye bethought an evil thought, and ye became a people doomed.
And whosoever believeth not in Allah and His apostle then verily We have gotten ready for the infidels a Blaze.
And Allah's is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgivEth whomsoever He Will and tormenteth whomsoever he will; and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who lagged behind will presently, When ye march forth to take spoils, leave us, we shall follow say you. They intend to change the word of Allah. Say thou: ye shall by no means follow us; thus hath Allah said afore. Then they will say: Aye! ye envy us. Aye! little it is they are wont to understand.
Say thou Unto those who lagged behind of the desert Arabs: surely ye shall be summoned against a people endued with exceeding violence then ye will fight them or they will submit. Then if ye obey, Allah will give ye a goodly hire; but if ye turn away even as ye turned away aforetime. He will torment you with a torment afflictive.
There is no blame upon the blind, nor is there blame upon the lame, nor is there blame upon the sick. And whosoever obeyeth Allah and His apostle, He will cause him enter Gardens where under rivers flow; and whosoever turneth away, him He shall torment with a torment afflictive.
Assuredly well-pleased was Allah with the believers when they sware fealty Unto thee under the tree, and he knew that which was in their hearts, wherefore He sent down tranquillity on them, and rewarded them with a victory near at hand.
And spoils in abundance that they are taking. And Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.
Allah hath promised you abundant spoils that ye shall take, and these He hath hastened to you, and hath restrained the hands of people from you, that it may be a sign Unto the believers, and that He may guide you to a straight path.
And He promiseth another victory, over which ye have as yet no power: Allah hath surely encompassed it; and Allah is over everything ever Potent.
And had those who disbelieve fought against you, surely they would have turned their backs, and then they would have found no patron nor helper.
That hath been the dispensation of Allah with those who passed away aforetime; and thou shalt not find in the dispensation of Allah any change.
And He it is Who restrained their hands from you and Your hands from them, in the vale of Makka so, after He had made you superior to them; and Allah is of that which ye work ever a Beholder.
They were those who disbelieved and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and hindered the detained offering that it should arrive at the goal thereof. And had it not been for believing men and believin women whom ye knew not, and that ye might have trampled on them and thus there might have befallen you crime on their account unwittingly. He had not restrained your hands from them. But this He did that He might bring into His mercy whomsoever He will. Had they been distinguished one from another, surely We had tormented those who disbelieved among them with a torment afflictive.
When those who disbelieve had put in their hearts a zeal, the zeal of Paganism, then Allah sent down His tranquillity upon His apostle and upon the believers, and kept them fixed on the way of piety, and they were worthy thereof and meet therefor; and Allah is of everything ever Knower.
Assuredly did Allah shew a true vision to His apostle in very truth; ye shall surely enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah willeth, secure, having your heads shaven and your hair cut, and ye shall not fear. He knoweth that which ye know not; wherefore He appointed, beside that, a victory near at hand.
He it is Who hath sent His apostle with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it prevail over all other religions, and Allah sufficeth as a Witness.
Muhammad is the apostle of Allah. And those who are with him are stern against the infidels and merciful among themselves; Thou beholdest them bowing down and falling prostrate, seeking grace from Allah and His goodWill Mark of them is on their faces from the effect of prostration: such is their similitude in the Taurat. And their similitude in the lnjil: like Unto a sown corn that putteth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it, and swelieth, and riseth upon the stalk thereof delighting the sowers. Such are the early Muslims described that He may enrage the infidels with them. Allah hath promised Unto those among them who believe and work righteous works, forgiveness and a mighty hire.
