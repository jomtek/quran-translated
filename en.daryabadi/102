The emulous desire of abundance engrosseth you,
Until ye visit the graves.
Lo! presently ye shall know.
Again lo! presently ye shall know.
Lo! would that ye knew now with the surety of knowledge!
Surely ye shall behold theScorch.
Then ye shall surely beholdwith the surety of vision.
Then, on that Day, ye shall surely be asked of the delights.
