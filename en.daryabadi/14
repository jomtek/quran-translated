Alif. Lam. Ra. This is a Book which We have sent down unto thee, that thou mayest bring the mankind forth from the darknesses unto the light, by the command of their Lord: unto the path of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.
Allah, whose is that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth; and woe be unto the infidels because of a torment severe
Those who prefer the life of the world to the Hereafter, and hinder people from the way of Allah, and seek crookedness therein; these are in error far-off.
And We sent not an apostle but with the speech of his people that he might expound unto them. Then Allah sendeth astray whomsoever He will, and guideth whomsoever He will. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.
And assuredly We sent Musa with our signs saying: bring thy people forth from the darknesses unto the light, and remind them of the annals of Allah. Verily therein are signs for everyone patient, and thankful.
And recall what time Musa said unto his people: remember the favour of Allah upon you when He delivered you from the house of Fir'awn who were imposing upon you evil torment, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live, and therein was from your Lord a trial terrible.
And what time your Lord proclaimed: if ye give thanks, surely I will increase you, and if ye disbelieve, verily My torment severe.
And Musa said: if ye disbelive, -- ye and all those who are on the earth-then verily Allah is self-sufficient, Praiseworthy. disquieting.
Hath not the tidings come to you of those before you: the people of Nuh and the 'Aad and the Thamud and those after them! None knoweth them save Allah. There came unto them their apostles with the evidences, but they put their hands to their mouths, and said: verily we disbelieve in that where- with ye have been sent, and verily regarding that to which ye call Us We are in doubt disquieting.
Their apostles said: is there doubt about Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth? He calleth you that he may forgive you of your sins and retain you till a term fixed. They said: ye are but like us; ye mean to turn us aside from that which our fathers have been worshipping; so bring us a warranty manifest.
Their apostles said unto them: we are naught but human beings like but Allah bestoweth favour on you, of His bond whomsoever He willeth and it is not for us to bring you a men command of warrantv except by the Allah. On Allah then let the believers rely.
And wherefore should we not rely on Allah when He hath surely guided us our ways! And surely we shall bear patiently that with which ye afflict us and in Allah then let the trustful put their trust.
And those who disbelieved said to their apostles: we will surely drive you forth from our land, or else ye will have to return to our faith. Then their Lord Revealed unto them: We will surely destroy the wrong-doers.
And We will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them: that is for him who feareth standing before Me and feareth My threat.
And they besought judgment, and disappointed was every tyrant obstinate.
Behind him is Hell, and he shall be made to drink of fetid water.
Which he gulpeth, but wellnigh swalloweth not. And death cometh upon him from every side, while yet he is not dead, and behind him is a torment terrible.
The likeness of those who disbelieve in their Lord: their works are like ashes upon which the wind bloweth hard on a stormy day: they shall not be able to get aught of that which they have earned. That! that is the straying far-off
Beholdest thou not that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with a purpose? If He willed He would make you pass away and bring a creation new.
And for Allah that is not hard.
And they all shall appear before Allah, then those who were counted weak shall say to those who were stiff-necked: verily we were unto you a following, are ye going to avail us at all against the torment of AllAh? They Will say: had Allah guided, We would have guided you also; it is equal unto us whether we become impatient or bear patiently; for us there is no place of escape.
And the Satan will say, When the affair hath been decreed: verily Allah promised you a promise of truth; and I promised you, then I failed; and I had over you no authoyourity, save that I called you and ye answered me; wherefore reproach not but reproach yourself. I am not me going to succour you nor are ye going to succour me: verily I disbelieve in your having associated me afore. Verily the wrong-doers! for them is a torment zfflictive.
And those who believed and worked righteous works shall be made to enter Gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein by the command of their Lord, their greeting therein will be: peace!
Beholdest thou not how Allah hath propounded the similitude of the clean word? It is like a clean tree, its root firmly fixed, and its branches reaching unto heaven.
Giving its fruit at every season, by the command of the Lord. And Allah propoundeth similitudes for mankind that haply they may be admonished.
And the similitude of the foul word is as a foul tree, uprooted from upon the earth, and there is for it no stability.
Allah keepeth firm those who believe by the firm Word in the life of the world and in the Hereafter, and Allah sendeth astray the wrong-doers. And Allah doth that which He willeth.
Beholdest thou not those who returned the favour of Allah with infidelity and caused their people to alight in the dwelling of perdition:
Hell, wherein they shall roast. How ill is the settlement!
And they have set up compeers unto Allah, that they may lead men astray from His way. Say thou: enjoy, then verily your vending is unto the Fire.
Say thou unto those of My bond- men who have believed, let them establish prayer and expend of that wherewith We have provided them secretly and openly, ere the Day cometh wherein there will be no bargain nor friendliness.
Allah it is who hath created the heavens and the earth, and sent down from the heaven water, and hath there by brought forth fruits as a provision for you; and He hath subiected the ships for you that it may run in the sea by His command; and He hath subjected for you the rivers.
And He hath subjected for you the sun and the moon, two constant toils; and He hath subjected for you the night and the day.
And He hath vouchsafed unto you some of everything ye asked Him. And if ye would count Allah's favours, ye can not compute them; verily man is a great wrong-doer, highly ungrateful.
And recall what time Ibrahim said: my Lord! make this City secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping the idols.
My Lord! they have sent astray many among mankind; whosoever followeth me, verily he is of me; and whosoever disobeyeth me, then verily Thou art Forgiving, Merciful.
Our Lord! verily have caused some of my progeny to dwell in a valley uncultivable near Thy Sacred House, Our Lord! in order that they may establish prayer; make Thou therefore the hearts of some of mankind to Yearn toward them, and provide them Thou With fruits, haply they may give thanks.
Our Lord! verily Thou knowest that which We conceal and that which We make known; and not of aught is concealed from Allah in the earth or in the heaven.
All praise be unto Allah who hath bestowed upon me, despite old age lsma'il and ls-haq; verily my Lord is the Hearer of supplication.
My Lord! make me establisher of prayer and also from my progeny, our Lord! and accept Thou my supplication.
Our Lord! forgive me and my parents and the believers on the Day whereon will be set up the reckoning.
And deem not Allah negligent of that which the wrong-doers work: He only deferreth them to a Day whereon the sighthall remain staring.
They hastening forward, their heads upraised, their look returning not unto them and their hearts void.
And warn thou the mankind of the Day whereon the torment will come unto them; then those who have done wrong shall say: our Lord! defer us to a term near at hand we will answer Thy call and we will follow the apostles. Were ye not wont to swear afore that for you there was to be no decline?
And ye dwell in the dwellings of those who had wronged themselves and it had become manifest unto you in what wise We had dealt with them, and We had propounded for you similitudes.
And of a surety theys Plotted their plot, and with Allah was their plot, though their plot was such as to remove thereby mountains.
So deem not thouthat Allah is going to fail His promise to His apostles; verily Allah is Mighty, Lord of vengeance
On the Day whereon the earth will be changed into other than the earth, and the heavens also; and all creatures will appear unto Allah, the One, the Subduer.
And thou wilt see the guilty on that Day bound together in fetters.
Their trouser hell be of pitch, and the Fire shall cover their faces.
That Allah may requite each soul according to that which he hath earned: verily Allah is swift in reckoning.
This is a preaching for mankind, and that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that there is only one God, and that the men of understanding may be admonished.
