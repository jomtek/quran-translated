O Prophet! fear Allah and obey not the infidels and the hypocrites; verily Allah is ever Knowing, Wise.
And follow that which is revealed to thee from thy Lord; verily Allah is of that which ye Work ever Aware.
And put thy trust in Allah and Allah sufficeth as a Trustee.
Allah hath not placed unto any man two hearts in his inside, nor hath He made your spouses whom ye declare to be as your mother's backs, your real mothers, nor hath He made your adopted sons your real sons. This is only your saying by your mouths, whereas Allah saith the truth and He guideth the way.
Call them by their fathers: that will be most equitable in the sight of Allah. And if ye know not their fathers then they are your brethren in religion and your friends. And there is no fault upon you in regard to the mistake ye have made therein, but in regard to that which your hearts intend purposely. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.
The Prophet is nigher unto the believers than themselves, and his wives are their mothers. And kinsmen are nigher one to another in the ordinance of Allah than other believers and the emigrants except that ye may act reputably unto your friends. This hath been written in the Book.
And recall what time We took a bond from the prophets and from thee and from Nuh and Ibrahim and Musa and 'Isa son of Maryam. And We took from them a solemn bond;
That he may question the truthful of their truth. And for the Infidels He hath gotten ready a torment afflictive.
O Ye who believe! remember Allah's favour unto you when there came unto you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and hosts which ye saw not, and Allah was of that which ye were working a Beholder.
When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when eyes turned aside and hearts reached to the gullets, and of Allah ye were imagining various things.
There were the believers proven and shaken with a mighty shaking
And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease were saying: Allah and His apostle have promised us nought but delusion.
And when a party of them said: O inhabitants of Yathrib! there is no place for you, so return. And a part of them asked leave of the Prophet, saying: verily our houses lie open; whereas they lay not open; they only wished to flee.
And if they were to be entered upon from the sides thereof and they were asked to sedition, they would surely have committed it, and they would have tarried therein but slightly.
And arruredly they had already covenanted with Allah that they would not turn their backs; verily the covenant with Allah must be questioned about.
Say thou: flight shall not profit you if ye flee from death or slaughter, and lo! ye will not enjoy life except for a little.
Say thou: who is there that will protect you from Allah if He intendeth to bring evil on you or intendeth mercy for you? And they shall not find for themselves, besides Allah, a patron or helper.
Surely Allah knoweth those among you who hinder and those who say unto their brethren: come hither unto us; and they themselves come not to the battle save a ittle,
Being niggardly toward you. Then when the fightin cometh, thou beholdest them look unto thee, their eyes rolling about, like the eyes of him who fainteth unto death. Then when the fighting is over they inveigh against you with sharp tongues, being niggardly of the good things. These have not believed; wherefore Allah hath made their works of none effect, and that is with Allah ever easy.
They deem that the confederates have not yet departed; and if the confederates should come, they would fain to be in the desert with the wandering Arabs inquiring for tidings of you. And if they happen to be amongst you, they would fight but little.
Assuredly there hath been for you: in the apostle of Allah an excellent pattern for him who hopeth in Allah and the Last Day and remembereth Allah much.
And when the believers saw the confederates, they said: this is that which Allah and His apostle had promised us; and Allah and His apostle had spoken the truth. And it only increased them in belief and in self-surrender.
Of the believers are men who have fulfilled that which they covenaned with Allah. Some of them have performed their vow, and some of them are waiting, so and they have not changed in the least.
All this happened in order that Allah may recompense the truthful for their truth, and may punish the hypocrites if He would, or relent toward them. Verily Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.
And Allah drave baCk those who disbelieved in their rage; they obtained no advantage, and Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting; and Allah is ever Strong, Mighty.
And He brought those of the people of the Book who backed them down from their fortresses and cast into their hearts terror; a part of them ye slew, and ye made captives a part.
And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their riches, and land which ye have not yet trodden. And Allah is over everything ever potent.
Prophet! say unto thy wives: if it be that ye seek the world's life and the adornment thereof, then come I shall make a provision for you and I shall release you with a handsome release.
And if ye seek Allah and His apostle and the abode of the Hereafter, then verily Allah hath gotten ready for the well-doers among you a mighty hire.
O Ye wives of the Prophet! whosoever of you shall commit a manifest Indecency, doubled for her would be the punishment twice over; and with Allah that is easy.
And whosoever of you shall be obedient unto Allah and His apostle and shall work righteously, her hire We shall give her twice over, and We have gotten ready for her a generous provision.
wives of the prophet! ye are not like any others of women, if ye are God-fearing. So be not soft in speech, lest one in whose heart is disease should be moved with desire, bun speak a reputable speech.
And stay in Your houses. and display not yourselves! with the display of the times of former Paganism; and establish the prayer and give the poor-rate and obey Allah and His apostle. Allah only desireth to take away uncleanness from you, people of the house-hold, and to purify you with a thorough purification.
And bear in mind that which is rehearsed in your homes of the revelations of Allah and the wisdom. Verily Allah is ever Subtile, Aware.
Verily the Muslim men and Muslim women, and the believing men and the believing women, and the devout men and the devout women, and the men of veracity and the women of veracity, and the persevering men and the persevering women, and the men of humility and the women of humility and the almsgiving men and the almsgiving women, and the fasting men and the fasting women, and the men who guard their modesty and the women who guard their modesty, and the Allah-remembering men and the Allah remembering women: Allah hath gotten ready for them forgiveness and mighty hire.
And it is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His apostle have decreed an affair, that they should have any choice in their affair. And whosoever disobeyeth Allah and His apostle hath strayed with a manifest straying.
And recall what time thou wast saying unto him on whom Allah had conferred favour and thou hadst conferred favour: keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah; so and thou wast concealing in thy mind that which Allah was going to disclose, and thou wast fearing mankind, whereas Allah had a better right that Him thou shouldst fear. Then when Zaid had performed his purpose concerning her, We wedded her to thee, that there should be no blame for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when they have performed their purpose concerning them. And the ordinance of Allah was to be fulfilled.
No blame there is upon the Prophet in that which Allah hath decreed for him. That hath been Allah's dispensation with those who have passed away afore - and the ordinance of Allah hath been a destiny destined
Those who preached the messages of Allah and feared Him, and feared none save Allah; and Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner.
Muhammad is not the father of any of your males, but the apostle of Allah and the seal of the prophets; and Allah of everything is ever the Knower.
O Ye who believe! remember Allah with much remembrance.
And hallow Him morning and evening.
He it is Who sendeth His benedictions to you and His angels also that he may bring you forth from darknessess into light; and unto the believers He is ever Merciful.
Their greeting on the Day whereon they meet Him will be: peace. And He hath gotten ready for them a generous hire.
Prophet! verily We have sent thee a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.
And a summoner unto Allah by His command and an illuminating lamp.
And bear thou unto the believers the glad tidings that theirs is from Allah a great grace.
And obey thou not the infidels and the hypocrites, and heed not their annoyances, and trust in Allah; and Allah sufficeth as a Trustee.
O Ye who believe! when ye marry believing women and then divorce them before ye have touched them, then there is no waiting-period from you incumbent on them that ye should count. So make provision for them and release them with a seemly release.
O Prophet! verily We have allowed unto thee thy wives unto whom thou hast given their hires, and also those whomsoever thy right hand ownEth of those whomsoever Allah hath given thee as spoils of war, and the daughters of thy paternal uncle, and the daughters of thy paternal aunts, and the daughters of thy maternal uncle, and the daughters of thy maternal aunts, who migrated with thee, and any believing woman, when she offereth herself unto the Prophet if the Prophet desire to wed her --purely for thee, above the rest of the believers. Surely We know that which We have ordained unto them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands won: in order that there may be no blame upon thee: And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.
Thou myest put off such of them as thou wilt, and thou mayest take unto thee such of them as thou wilt; and whomsoever thou desirest if such as thou hadst set aside there is no blame upon thee. This is likelier to cool their eyes and not let them grieve and to keep them pleased with whatsoever thou shalt give every one of them. Allah knoweth that which is in your hearts. and Allah is ever Knowing, Forbearing.
Women are not allowed unto thee henceforth, nor mayest thou change them for other wives although their beauty please thee, save those whom thy right hand shall own; and Allah is ever over everything a Watcher.
O Ye who believe! enter not the houses of the Prophet, except when leave is given you, for a meal and at a time that ye will have to wait for its preparation; but when ye are invited, then enter, and when ye have eaten, then disperse, without lingering to enter into familiar discourse. Verily that incommodeth the Prophet, and he is shy of asking you to depart, bur Allah is not shy of the truth. And when ye ask of them aught, ask it of them from behind a curtain. That shall be purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not lawful for you that ye should cause annoyance to the apostle of Allah, nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him; verily that in the sight of Allah shall be an enormity.
Whether ye disclose a thing or conceal it, verily Allah is of everything ever Knower.
It is no sin for them in respect to their fathers or their brothers, or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their own women, or those whom their right hands own; and fear Allah; verily Allah is of everything ever a Witness.
Verily Allah and His angels send their benedictions upon the prophet. O ye who believe! send your benedictions upon him and salute him with a goodly Salutation.
Verily those who annoy Allah and His apostle, --Allah hath cursed them in the world and the Hereafter, and hath gotten ready for them a torment Ignominious.
And those who annoy the believing men and the believing women, without their earning it, shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and manifest sin.
O Prophet! say unto thy wives and thy daughters and women of the believers that they should let down upon them their wrapping- garments. That would be more likely to distinguish them so that they will not be affronted. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.
If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and the raisers of commotion in Madina desist not, We shall surely set thee up against them; thenceforth they shall not be suffered to neighbour thee therein except for a little while.
Accursed; wherever found they shall be laid hold of and slain with a relentless slaughter.
That hath been the dispensation of Allah with those who have passed away afore; and thou shalt not find in the dispensation of Allah any change.
People ask thee ccncerning the Hour. Say thou: the knowledge there of is only with Allah: and what knowest thou! --belike the Hour is nigh.
Verily Allah hath cursed the infidels, and hath gotten ready for them a Blaze.
Abiders therein they shall be for ever, and they shall find neither a protecting friend nor a helper.
On the Day whereon their faces shall be rolled in the Fire, they will say: Oh that we had obeyed Allah and had obeyed the apostle!
And they will say: our Lord! verily we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they led us astray from the way.
Our Lord! give them double torment and curse them with a great curse.
O Ye who believe! be not like unto those who annoyed Musa; but Allah cleared him of that which they said, and he was in the sight of Allah illustrious.
O Ye who believe! fear Allah, and speak a straight speech.
He WiLL rectify for you your works, and forgive you your sins. And Whosoever obeyeth Allah and His apostle, he hath indeed achieved a mighty achievement.
Verily We! We offered the trust unto the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it and shrank therefor. And man bore it; verily he was very iniquitous and very ignorant-
So that Allah will torment the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the associators and the associatoresses and Allah will relent toward believing men and the believing women; and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful
