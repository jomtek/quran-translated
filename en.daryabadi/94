Have We not opened forth for thee thy breast?
And We have taken off from thee thy burthen,
Which weighed down thy back.
And We have upraised for thee thy renown.
Then verily along with every hardship is ease.
Verily along with every hardship is ease.
Then when thou becometh relieved, toil;
And Unto thine Lord, attend.
