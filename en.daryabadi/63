When the hypocrites come Unto thee, they say: we bear witness that thou art indeed the apostle of Allah. Allah knoweth that thou art indeed His apostle, and Allah beareth witness that; the hypocrites are indeed liars.
They have taken their oaths for a shield; then they turn away men from the way of Allah. Verily vile is that which they have been working.
That is, because they believed, and thereafter disbelieved, wherefore their hearts are sealed, so that they understand not.
And when thou beholdest them, their persons please thee: and if they speak, thou listenest to their discourse; they are as though they were blocks of wood propped up. They deem every shout to be against them. They are the enemy; so beware of them. Perish them Allah! whither are they deviating!
And when it is said Unto them: come! that the apostle of Allah may ask forgiveness for you, they twist their heads, and thou beholdest them retire, while they are stiff-necked.
Equal it is Unto them: whether thou askest forgiveness for them or askest not forgiveness for them, Allah shall forgive them not. Verily Allah guideth not a transgressing people.
They are the ones who say: expend not on those who are with Allah's apostle, that they may disperse; whereas Allah's are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; yet the hypocrites understand not.
They say: surely, if we return to Madina the mightier shall drive out the meaner thence: whereas might is Allah's and His apostle's and the believers; yet the hypocrites know not.
O ye who believe let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whosoever doth that then those! they are the losers.
And expend of that wherewith We have provided you afore death cometh Unto one of you, and he saith: 'my Lord! wouldst Thou not defer me for a short term, so that I would give alms and become of the righteous.
And Allah deferreth not a soul when its term- hath come; and Allah is Aware of that which ye do.
