When the sun shall be wound round,
And when the stars shall dart down,
And when the mountains shall be made to pass away,
And when the she-camels big with young shall be abandoned,
And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together,
And when the seas shall be filled,
And when the souls he paired,
And when the girl buried alive shall be asked:
For what sin she was slain.
And when the Writs shall be lain open,
And when the heaven shall be stripped,
And when the Scorch shall be made to blaze,
And when the Garden shall be brought nigh,
Then every soul shall know that which it: hath presented.
I swear by the receding stars.
Moving swiftly and hiding themselves,
And by the night when it departeth,
And by the morning when it shineth forth,
Verily it is a Word brought by a messenger honoured,
Owner of strength, of established dignity with the Lord of the Throne.
Obeyed one there; trustWorthy.
Nor is your companion distracted.
Assuredly he beheld him in the horizon manifest.
And he is of the unseen not a tenacious concealer.
Nor is it the word of a Satan accursed.
Whither then go ye?
This is naught but an Admonition Unto the worlds-
Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight.
And ye shall not will unless it be that Allah, the Lord of the worlds, willeth.
