By the heaven adorned with big stars.
And by the Day promised,
And by the Day witnessing and the Day witnessed,
Perish the fellows of the ditch,
Of fire fuel-fed,
When they sat by it
And to that which they did to the believers were witnesses.
And they persecuted them for naught save that they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy
Him, Whose is the dominion of heavens and the earth. And Allah is over everything a Witness.
Verily those who affected the believing men and the believing women, and then repented not, theirs shall be the torment of Hell, and theirs shall be the torment of burning.
Verily those who believed and worked righteons works, theirs shall be Gardens whereunder the rivers flow; that is the supreme achievement.
Verily the grip of thine Lord is severe.
Verily He! He it is who beginneth and repeateth it.
And He is the Fogiving, the Loving,
Lord of the Throne, the Glorious,
Doer of whatsoever He intendeth.
Hath there come Unto thee the story of the hosts-
Of the Fir'awn and the Thamud?
But those who disbelieve are engaged in denial.
Whereas Allah is, from behind them, Encompassing.
Aye! it is a Recitation glorious,
Inscribed in a tablet preserved.
