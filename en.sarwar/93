By the midday brightness
and by the calm of night,
(Muhammad), your Lord has not abandoned you (by not sending you His revelation), nor is He displeased with you.
The reward in the next life will certainly be better for you than worldly gains.
Your Lord will soon grant you sufficient favors to please you.
Did He not find you as an orphan and give you shelter?
Did He not find you wandering about and give you guidance?
And did He not find you in need and make you rich?
Do not oppress the orphans
and do not reject the beggars
and proclaim the bounties of your Lord.
