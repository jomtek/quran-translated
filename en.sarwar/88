Have you heard the story of the overwhelming event (the Day of Judgment)?
On that day the faces of some people will be humbly cast down,
troubled and tired as a result of their deeds in the past.
They will suffer the heat of the blazing fire
and will be made to drink from a fiercely boiling spring.
They will have no food other than bitter and thorny fruit
which will neither fatten them nor satisfy them.
However, on that day the faces of other people will be happy.
and pleased with the result of their deeds in the past.
They will live in an exalted garden
wherein they will not hear any vain talk.
Therein will be a flowing spring,
raised couches,
well arranged goblets,
well-placed cushions,
and well spread carpets.
Have they not looked at how the camel is created,
how the heavens are raised up high,
how the mountains are set firm,
and how the earth is spread out?
(Muhammad), preach; you are only a preacher.
You do not have full control over them.
However, those who turn away and disbelieve,
God will punish them with the greatest torment.
To Us they will all return.
In Our hands are their accounts.
