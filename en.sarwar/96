(Muhammad), read in the name of your Lord who created (all things).
He created man from a clot of blood.
Recite! Your Lord is the most Honorable One,
who, by the pen, taught the human being:
He taught the human being what he did not know.
Despite this, the human being still tends to rebel
because he thinks that he is independent.
However, (all things) will return to your Lord.
Have you seen the one who prohibits
a servant of Ours from prayer?
What will happen if the praying person is rightly guided
or if he commands others to maintain piety!?
What will happen if the prohibiting rejects the Truth and turns away from it!?
Does he not realize that God sees him?
Let him know that if he does not desist, We shall certainly drag him by his forelocks,
his lying sinful forelock.
Let him call on his associates for help
and We too will call the stern and angry keepers of hell.
(Muhammad), never yield to him! Prostrate yourself and try to come closer to God.
