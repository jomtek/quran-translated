By the dawn,
by the Ten (secret) Nights,
by the odd and even (8th and 9th Dhil-hajj)
and by the night when it moves on towards daybreak (reward and retribution in the next life is an absolute reality).
Is this not a sufficient oath for intelligent people?
(Muhammad), consider how your Lord dealt with the tribe of Ad,
the people of the huge columned city of Eram
whose like has never been created in any other land.
(Also consider how He dealt with) the Thamud, who carved their houses out of the rocks in the valley.
(Also consider the people of) the Pharaoh who victimized people by placing them on the stake,
led rebellious lives,
and spread much corruption in the land.
Thus, your Lord afflicted them with torment;
your Lord keeps an eye on (all evil-doing people).
As for the human being, when his Lord tests him, honors him, and grants him bounty, he says, "God has honored me".
However, when his Lord tests him by a measured amount of sustenance, he says, "God has disgraced me".
(Since wealth does not necessarily guarantee everlasting happiness) then why do you not show kindness to the orphans,
or urge one another to feed the destitute?
Why do you take away the inheritance of others indiscriminately
and why do you have an excessive love of riches?
When the earth is crushed into small pieces
and (when you find yourself) in the presence of your Lord and the rows and rows of angels, your greed for riches will certainly be of no avail to you.
On that day, hell will be brought closer and the human being will come to his senses, but this will be of no avail to him.
He will say, "Would that I had done some good deeds for this life".
On that day the punishment of God and His detention will be unparalleled.
And His bonds will be such as none other can bind.
Serene soul,
return to your Lord well pleased with him and He will be pleased with you.
Enter among My servants
into My Paradise.
