(I swear) by the snorting chargers (of the warriors), whose hoofs strike against the rocks
and produce sparks
while running during a raid at dawn,
and leave behind a cloud of dust
which engulfs the enemy.
The human being is certainly ungrateful to his Lord.
He himself knows this very well.
He certainly has a strong love for wealth and riches.
Does he not know that on the day when those in the graves are resurrected
and all that is in the hearts is made public,
their Lord will examine his deeds?
