All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God. He is the Majestic and All-wise.
Believers, why do you preach what you do not practice?
It is most hateful in the sight of God if you say something and do not practice it.
God loves those who fight for His cause in battlefield formations firm as an unbreakable concrete wall.
Moses said to his people, "Why do you create difficulties for me when you know that I am God's Messenger to you?" When they deviated (from the right path), God led their hearts astray. God does not guide the evil-doing people.
Jesus, son of Mary, said to the Israelites, "I am the Messenger of God sent to you. I confirm the Torah which is in existence and give you the glad news of the coming of a Messenger who will come after me named Ahmad." When this Messenger came to them with all the proofs (to support his truthfulness), they said, "He is simply a magician".
Who is more unjust than one who creates falsehood against God when he has already been invited to Islam? God does not guide the unjust people.
They want to put out the light of God with their mouths, but God will certainly make His light shine forever - even though the disbelievers may dislike this.
It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the true religion to stand supreme over all religions, even though the pagans may dislike it.
Believers, shall I show you a bargain which will save you from the painful torment?
Have faith in God and His Messenger and strive hard for His cause with your wealth and in persons. This is better for you if only you knew it.
God will forgive your sins and admit you into Paradise wherein streams flow, and you live in the lofty mansions of the garden of Eden. This is indeed the greatest triumph.
(Besides forgiveness) you will receive other favors which you will love: help from God and an immediate victory (Muhammad), give such glad news to the believers.
Believers, be the helpers of God just as when Jesus, the son of Mary, asked the disciples, "Who will be my helpers for the cause of God?" and the disciples replied, "We are the helpers of God." A group of the Israelites believed in him and others rejected him. We helped the believers against their enemies and they became victorious.
