I do not (need to) swear by this town (Mecca)
in which you are now living
or by the great father and his wonderful son (Abraham and Ishmael)
that We have created the human being to face a great deal of hardship.
Does He think that no one will ever have control over him?
(He boasts and shows off) saying, "I have spent a great deal of money (for the cause of God)".
Does he think that no one has seen him?
Have We not given him two eyes,
a tongue, and two lips?
Have We not shown him the ways of good and evil?
Yet, he has not entered into Aqaba
Would that you knew what Aqaba is!
It is the setting free of a slave
or, in a day of famine, the feeding of
an orphaned relative
and downtrodden destitute person, (so that he would be of)
the believers who cooperate with others in patience (steadfastness) and kindness.
These are the people of the right hand.
As for those who disbelieve in Our revelations, they are the people of the left
who will be engulfed in the fire.
