(On the day) when the sun is made to cease shining,
the stars are made to fade away,
the mountains are scattered about as dust,
the young barren camels are abandoned,
the wild beasts are herded together,
the oceans are brought to a boil,
souls are reunited with their bodies,
questions are asked about the baby girls buried alive,
such as, "For what crime were they murdered?"
the records of deeds are made public,
the heavens are unveiled,
hell is made to blaze,
and Paradise is brought near,
then every soul will discover the consequence of its deeds.
I do not need to swear by the orbiting
stars which are visible during the night
and sit during the day, or by the darkening night
and brightening morning,
that the Quran is the word of the honorable angelic, mighty Messenger
who is honored in the presence of the Lord of the Throne,
obeyed by (all creatures) and faithful to His trust.
Your companion (Muhammad) does not suffer from any mental illness
He certainly saw him (Gabriel) high up on the horizon in his original form
He (Muhammad) is not accused of lying about the unseen.
The Quran is not the word of condemned satan.
Where then will you go?
This is certainly the guidance for all (jinn and mankind).
So let those who want, choose the right guidance
However, you will not be able to choose anything unless God, Lord of the Universe wills it to be so.
