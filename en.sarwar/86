By the heavens and al-tariq.
Do you know what al-tariq is?
(It is a nightly radiant star).
There is no soul which is not guarded (by the two angels who record all of its deeds).
Let the human being reflect that from what he has been created.
He has been created from an ejected drop of fluid
which comes out of the loins and ribs.
God has all power to resurrect him.
On the day when all secrets will be made public,
he will have no power, nor anyone to help him.
By the rotating heavens
and the replenishing earth,
the Quran is the final word,
and it is certainly not a jest.
They (disbelievers) plot every evil plan,
but I too plan against them.
Give respite to the disbelievers and leave them alone for a while.
