The (unprecedented) crash!
What is the crash?
Would that you knew what the crash is!
On that day, people will be like scattered moths
and mountains will be like carded wool.
Those whose good deeds will weigh heavier (on the scale)
will live a pleasant life,
but those whose good deeds will be lighter (on the scale).
will have hawiyah as their dwelling.
Would that you knew what hawiya his?
It is a burning Fire.
