Ha. Mim.
This Book is revealed from God the Majestic and All-wise.
We have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them ONLY for a genuine purpose and an appointed time. The unbelievers ignore that of which they have been warned.
(Muhammad), ask them, "Have you thought about what you worship besides God? Show me which part of the earth they have created. Do they have a share in the creation of the heavens? Bring me a Book, revealed before this Quran, or any other proof based on knowledge to support your belief, if indeed you are truthful".
Who is more astray than one who prays to things besides God; things that would not be able to answer his prayers even if he would wait till the Day of Judgment. They are not even aware of his prayers.
When people will be resurrected, such gods will become their enemies and will reject their worship.
When Our enlightening revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers, of the truth which has come to them, say, "This is plain magic".
They say, "(Muhammad) has invented it (Quran) by himself." Say, "Had I invented it, you would not have been able to rescue me from God. He knows best what you say about it. He is our witness and He is All-forgiving and All-merciful".
Say, "I am not the first Messenger. I do not know what will be done to me or to you. I follow only what has been revealed to me and my duty is only to give clear warning".
Say, "What do you think will happen if this Quran is from God and you have rejected it? Besides, a witness from among the Israelites has testified to the divinity of a Book like it and believed in it (Quran) while you have arrogantly denied it. God does not guide the unjust.
The disbelievers have said about the believers, "Had there been anything good in it (Quran), they could not have accepted it before us" Since they do not benefit from its guidance, they say, "It (Quran) is only a fabricated legend".
Before this (Quran), the Book of Moses was a guide and a blessing. This Book confirms the Torah. It is in the Arabic language so that it may warn the unjust people, and give glad news to the righteous ones.
Those who have said, "Our Lord is God," and are steadfast in their belief need have no fear or be grieved.
They will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever as a reward for what they have done.
We have advised the human being to be kind to his parents; his mother bore him with hardship and delivered him while suffering a great deal of pain. The period in which his mother bore and weaned him lasted for thirty months. When he grew-up to manhood and became forty years old, he then said, "Lord, inspire me to give You thanks for the bounties you have granted to me and my parents, and to act righteously to please You. Lord, make my offspring virtuous. Lord I turn to you in repentance; I am a Muslim".
These are the ones from whom We accept righteous deeds and ignore their bad deeds. They will be among the dwellers of Paradise. It is the true promise which was given to them.
There are people who say to their parents, "Fie upon you! Are you telling us that we shall be raised from our graves? So many people have died before us and (none of them have been raised)" Their parents plead to God and say to their child, "Woe to you! Have faith; the promise of God is certainly true" They reply, "What you say is only ancient legends".
Such people will be subject to the punishment of God, which was also decreed for many human beings and jinn before them. These people are certainly lost.
Everyone will have a position proportionate to the degree of his deeds. Finally, God will recompense them for their deeds and they will not be wronged.
On the day when the disbelievers will be exposed to the fire, they will be told, "You have spent your happy days during your worldly life and enjoyed them. On this day you will suffer a humiliating torment for your unreasonably arrogant manners on earth and for the evil deeds which you have committed".
(Muhammad), recall the brother of the people of Ad, when he warned his people in the valley of al-ahqaf saying, "There existed many warners before and after him. Do not worship anything other than God. I am afraid for you about the torment of the great Day".
They said, "Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Show us that with which you threaten us if you are truthful".
He said, "Only God has the knowledge (of the coming of such torment). I preach to you the message that I have brought, but I can see that you are an ignorant people".
When they saw the torment as a cloud proceeding to their valleys, they said, "This cloud will bring us rain." He said, "No, it is the torment which you wanted to suffer immediately. It is a wind bearing and painful torment.
It will destroy everything by the will of its Lord" (Not very long after) nothing could be seen of them except their dwellings. Thus do We recompense the sinful people.
We had established them more firmly in the land than you are. We had given them ears, eyes, and hearts but none of their ears, eyes, and hearts proved to be of any benefit to them; they rejected the revelations of God and the torment which they mocked brought upon them utter destruction.
We destroyed some towns around you and showed you the evidence (of the Truth) so that perhaps you would turn (to God).
Why did the idols, whom they worshipped as a means of pleasing God, not help them? In fact, they proved to be the cause of their going astray and it were lies which they had falsely invented lies.
We turned a party of jinn towards you to listen to the Quran. When they attended a Quranic recitation, they said to each other, "Be silent," and, when it was over, they turned back to their people, in warning,
and said, "Our people, we have listened to the recitation of a Book revealed after Moses. It confirms the Books revealed before and guides to the Truth and the right path.
Our people, respond favorably to the Messenger of God and believe in Him. He will forgive your sins and rescue you from the painful torment.
Those who do not favorably respond to the Messenger of God should know that they cannot challenge God on earth and will not have anyone as their guardian besides Him. Such people are in plain error".
Have they not seen that God has created the heavens and the earth and that He experienced no fatigue in doing this. He has the power to bring the dead back to life. Certainly He has power over all things.
On the day when the disbelievers will be exposed to the fire, they will be asked, "Is this not real?" They will say, "Yes, Our Lord, it is real" He will say, "Suffer the torment for your disbelief".
(Muhammad), exercise patience as did the steadfast Messengers. Do not try to make them suffer the torment immediately; on the day when they will see the torment with which they were threatened, they will think that they had lived no more than an hour. The message has been delivered. No one else will be destroyed except the evil doing people.
