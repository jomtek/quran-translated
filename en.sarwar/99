When the earth is shaken by a terrible quake
and it throws out its burden,
the human being will say (in horror), "What is happening to it?"
On that day the earth will declare all (the activities of the human being) which have taken place on it,
having been inspired by your Lord.
On that day, people will come out of their graves in different groups to see (the results of) their own deeds.
Whoever has done an atom's weight of good,
will see it and whoever has done an atom's weight of evil, will also see it.
