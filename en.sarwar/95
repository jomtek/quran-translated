By the fig, by the olive,
by Mount Sinai
and by this inviolable city, Mecca.
We have created the human being in the best form
and We shall make him the lowest of low
except the righteously striving believers who will have a never ending reward.
After (knowing) this, what makes you still disbelieve in the Day of Judgment?
Is God not the best of the Judges?
