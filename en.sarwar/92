By the night when it covers the day,
by the day when it appears radiant,
and by that (Power) which created the male and female,
you strive in various ways.
We shall facilitate the path to bliss
for those who spend for the cause of God,
observe piety, and believe in receiving rewards from God.
But for those who are niggardly, horde their wealth,
and have no faith in receiving any reward (from God).
We shall facilitate the path to affliction
and their wealth will be of no benefit to them when they face destruction.
Surely, in Our hands is guidance,
and to Us belong the hereafter and the worldly life.
I have warned you about the fierce blazing fire
in which no one will suffer forever
except the wicked ones who have rejected the (Truth) and have turned away from it.
The pious ones who spend for the cause of God
and purify themselves will be safe from this fire.
They do not expect any reward
except the pleasure of their Lord, the Most High
and the reward (of their Lord) will certainly make them happy.
