Alif. Lam. Ra. A Book has been revealed to you, (Muhammad), so that, by the permission of their Lord, you would be able to lead people from darkness into light along the path of the Majestic, Praised One.
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Woe to the disbelievers; they will face the most severe punishment!
It is they who have given preference to the worldly life over the life to come. They create obstacles in the way that leads to God and try to make it seem crooked. They are in manifest error.
All the Messengers that We sent spoke the language of their people so that they could explain (their message to them). God guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants. He is Majestic and All-wise.
We sent Moses and gave him miracles in order to lead his people from darkness into light and to remind them of the days of God. In this there is evidence (of the truth) for those who exercise patience and give thanks.
Moses told his people, "Remember the favors that God granted you when He saved you from the people of the Pharaoh who had punished you in the worst manner by murdering your sons and keeping your women alive. It was a great trial for you from your Lord.
"Remember when your Lord said to you, 'If you give thanks, I shall give you greater (favors), but if you deny the Truth, know that My retribution is severe ".
Moses told his people, "If you and everyone on the earth turn to disbelief, know that God is Self-sufficient and Praiseworthy."
Have you (believers) ever heard the news about those who lived before you, like the people of Noah, Ad, Thamud, and those who lived after them? No one knows about them except God. Messengers were sent to them with miracles, but they put their hands to their mouths and said, "We do not believe in whatever you preach and we are also doubtful and uncertain about that to which you invite us."
The Messengers asked them, "Could there be any doubt about the existence of God who has created the heavens and the earth? He calls you to Himself to forgive your sins. He gives you respite only until the appointed time." They said, "You are mere mortals like us. What you want is to prevent us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped. Show us clear proof (if what you say is true)."
The Messengers replied, "We are certainly mere mortals like you, but God bestows His favors on whichever of His servants He wants. We can not bring you authority without the permission of God. The faithful should trust in God alone.
Why should we not trust in God when He has shown us the right way? We shall exercise patience against the troubles with which you afflict us. Whoever needs a trustee should trust in God."
The disbelievers told the Messengers, "We shall expel you from our land unless you revert to our religion." Their Lord then sent them (the messengers) a revelation, "We have decided to destroy the unjust
and settle you in the land thereafter. This is for those who are afraid of Me and of My warning."
They prayed for victory and the haughty transgressors were defeated.
Thereafter they will face hell fire wherein they will drink boiling water.
As they sip the unpleasant water, death will approach them from all sides, but they will never die. In addition to this, they will experience the most intense torment.
The deeds of those who deny the existence of their Lord are like ashes blown about by a strong wind on a stormy day. They will achieve nothing from their deeds. (What they have done) is a manifest error.
Do you not realize that God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
and that it is not at all difficult for God to replace you with another creature if He so wills?
(On the Day of Judgment) everyone will appear before God and those who have been suppressed will say to their oppressors, "We were your followers, can you do anything to rescue us from the torment of God?" They will reply, "Had God guided us, we would also have guided you. It makes no difference whether we cry for help or exercise patience; there is no escape for us."
When the decree of God is issued, satan will say, "God's promise to you was true, but I, too, made a promise to you and disregarded it. I had no authority over you. I just called you and you answered. Do not blame me but blame yourselves. I cannot help you and you cannot help me. I did not agree with your belief that I was equal to God." The unjust will face a painful punishment.
The righteously striving believers will be admitted to the gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever, by the permission of their Lord. Their greeting to each other will be, "Peace be with you."
Consider (Muhammad) how God (in a parable) compares the blessed Word to that of a blessed tree which has firm roots and branches rising up into the sky
and yields fruits in every season, by the permission of its Lord? God sets forth parables for people so that they may take heed.
An evil word is compared to an evil tree with no firm roots in the land and thus has no stability.
God strengthens the faith of the believers by the true Words in this world and in the life to come. He causes the unjust to go astray and does whatever He pleases.
Have you not seen those who changed the Word of God through disbelief and led their people to destruction?
They will suffer in Hell. What a terrible place to stay!
To lead people astray, they claimed their idols were equal to God. (Muhammad), tell them, "Enjoy yourselves and know that the only place for you to go will be hell fire."
Tell My believing servants to be steadfast in prayer and to spend for the cause of their Lord, both in private and in public, out of what We have given them. Let them do this before the coming of the day when there will be no merchandising or friendship.
God is the One who created the heavens and the earth, sent down water from the sky by which He produced fruits for your sustenance, enabled you to use boats to sail on the sea, and placed the rivers at your disposal, all by His command.
He made the sun and moon, each following its course, and the day and the night all subservient to you.
He has given you everything that you asked Him for. Had you wanted to count the bounties of God, you would not have been able to do it. The human being is unjust and disbelieving.
(Muhammad), consider when Abraham prayed, "Lord, make this (Mecca) a peaceful territory and save me and my offspring from worshipping idols.
Lord, the idols have misled many people. Whoever follows me is my friend. As for those who disobey, You are certainly All-forgiving and All-merciful.
"Lord, I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley near your Sacred House so that they could be steadfast in prayer. Lord, fill the hearts of the people with love for them and produce fruits for their sustenance so that they may give thanks.
Lord, You know all that we conceal or reveal. Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from God.
It is only God who deserves all praise. I praise Him for His giving me my sons Ishmael and Isaac during my old age. My Lord, certainly, hears all prayers.
Lord, make me and my offspring steadfast in prayer and accept our worship.
Lord, on the Day of Judgment, forgive me and my parents and all the believers."
(Muhammad), do not think that God is unaware of what the unjust people do. He only gives them a respite until the day when the eyes will stare fixedly,
when people will hurry in fright, their heads raised, their eyes unable to look around, and their hearts stunned due to the confusion (which will prevail on that Day).
(Muhammad), warn the people of the day when torment will approach them and the unjust will say, "Lord, give us respite for a little time so that we may answer your call and follow the Messengers." (The answer to their prayer will be), "Did you not swear before that you would never perish?
You lived in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, even though it was made clear to you how We dealt with them. We also showed you examples."
They devised evil plans which were so sinful that even the mountains could not endure them. All these were known to God.
You must not even think that God will disregard His promise to His messengers. God is Majestic and Revengeful.
On the day when the earth and the heavens will be replaced by another earth and heavens and everyone will be brought before the One Almighty God,
you will see the guilty ones bound in chains,
with garments of pitch and faces covered by fire.
This is how God will recompense each soul for its deeds. God's reckoning is swift.
This is an admonition for the people that they will be warned and know that He is the only God, and so that the people of understanding may take heed.
