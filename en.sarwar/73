You, who have wrapped yourself up with a mantle,
worship (God) for a few hours at night.
(Worship Him) for more or less than half of the night
and recite the Quran in a distinct tone;
We are about to reveal to you a mighty word.
Prayer at night leaves the strongest impression on one's soul and the words spoken are more consistent.
During the day, you are preoccupied with many activities.
Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Lord of the eastern and western regions, with due sincerity.
He is the only Lord, so choose Him as your guardian.
Bear patiently whatever they say, do not yield to them and keep on preaching decently to them.
Leave the prosperous disbelievers to Me and give them respite for a little while;
We have prepared for them fetters, flaming fire,
food which chokes (them), and a painful torment.
On that day, the earth and the mountains will be violently shaken, and the mountains will be turned into heaps of moving sand.
We have sent you a Messenger, who will witness your deeds, just as We sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh.
However, the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger and We seized him with a severe retribution.
If you, disbelieve, how will you be able to protect yourselves from the hardships of the day which would even turn children grey-headed?
On that day, the heavens will be rent asunder. This is the decree of God which has already been ordained.
This is a reminder. Let anyone who wants, seek guidance from his Lord.
Your Lord knows that you and a group of those who are with you get up for prayer sometimes for less than two-thirds of the night, sometimes half and sometimes one-third of it. God determines the duration of the night and day. He knew that it would be hard for you to keep an exact account of the timing of the night prayers, so He turned to you with forgiveness. Thus, recite from the Quran as much as possible. He knew that some of you would be sick, others would travel in the land to seek God's favors, and still others would fight for the cause of God. Thus, recite from the Quran as much as possible, be steadfast in prayer, pay the zakat, and give virtuous loans to God. Whatever good deeds you save for the next life, you will certainly find them with God. This is the best investment, and for this you will find the greatest reward. Ask forgiveness from God. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
