(Muhammad), have We not comforted your heart,
relieved you of the burden
which had been a heavy weight upon your back
and granted you an exalted reputation?
After every difficulty there is relief.
Certainly, after every difficulty there comes relief.
When you are free from (your obligations), strive hard (to worship God)
and be devoted to your Lord's service.
