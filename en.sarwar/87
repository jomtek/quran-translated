(Muhammad), glorify the Name of your lord, the Most High,
Who has created (all things) proportionately,
decreed their destinies, and provided them with guidance.
It is He who has caused the grass to grow,
then caused it to wither away.
We shall teach you (the Quran) and you will not forget it
unless God wills it to be otherwise. He knows all that is made public and all that remains hidden.
We shall make all your tasks easy.
Therefore, keep on preaching as long as it is of benefit.
Those who have fear of God will benefit
but the reprobates will turn away
and suffer the heat of the great fire
wherein they will neither live nor die.
Lasting happiness will be for those who purify themselves,
remember the name of the Lord, and pray to Him.
However, (the disbelievers) prefer the worldly life
even though the life hereafter will be better and will last forever.
This is what is written in the ancient heavenly Books,
the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
