By the heavens with constellations,
by the promised day,
and by the witness (Muhammad) and that which is witnessed (the Day of Judgment),
may the people be condemned those who tortured (the believers) in ditches
by a burning fire
while they themselves sat around it
witnessing what they were doing.
The only reason for which they tormented the believers was the latter's belief in God, the Majestic, and Praiseworthy.
and the One to whom belongs the heavens and the earth. God is the Witness of all things.
Those who persecute the believing men and women without repenting will suffer the torment of hell and that of the burning fire.
As for the righteously striving believers, they will live in Paradise wherein streams flow. This is the greatest triumph.
The vengeance of God is terribly severe.
It is He who creates all things and causes them to return.
He is the All-forgiving, the Most Loving One,
the Owner of the Throne, the Glorious One,
and the Most Effective in His decision.
Have you not heard about the stories of the armies
of the Pharaoh and Thamud?
In fact, the disbelievers had always rejected (Our revelations).
However, God encompassed their activities.
What is revealed to you is certainly a glorious Quran
that exists in a well-guarded tablet.
