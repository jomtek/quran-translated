The disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans disbelieved (in Islam) only after receiving divine testimony:
a Messenger (Muhammad) from God, reciting to them parts of the purified,
holy Book which contain eternal laws of guidance.
Nor did the People of the Book disagreed among themselves until after receiving the ancient divine testaments.
They were only commanded to worship God, be uprightly devoted to His religion, steadfast in prayer and pay the zakat. This is truly the eternal religion.
The disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans will dwell forever in hell; they are the worst of all creatures.
The righteously striving believers are the best of all creatures.
Their reward from their Lord will be the gardens of Eden wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever. God will be pleased with them and they will be pleased with Him. This (reward) is for those who fear their Lord.
