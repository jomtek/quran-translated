Woe to every slanderer and backbiter
who collects and hordes wealth,
thinking that his property will make him live forever.
By no means! They will be thrown into hutamah.
Would that you knew what hutamah is!
It is a fierce fire created by God
to penetrate into the hearts.
It will engulf them.
in its long columns of flames.
