The desire to have more of the worldly gains have pre-occupied you so much (that you have neglected remembring God),
until you come to the graves.
You shall know.
You shall cetainly know (about the consequences of your deeds).
You will certainly have the knowledge of your deeds beyond all doubt.
You will be shown hell
and you will see it with your own eyes.
Then, on that day, you will be questioned about the bounties (of God).
