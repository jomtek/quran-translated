O People who Believe! Fulfil your words (agreements); the mute animals are made lawful for you (to eat) except what will be declared to you after this, but do not assume hunting as lawful when you are on the pilgrimage; indeed Allah commands whatever He wills.
O People who Believe! Do not make lawful the symbols of Allah nor the sacred months nor the sacrificial animals sent to Sacred Territory (around Mecca) nor the animals marked with garlands, nor the lives and wealth of those travelling towards the Sacred House (Kaa’bah) seeking the munificence and pleasure of their Lord; and when you have completed the pilgrimage, you may hunt; and let not the enmity of the people who had stopped you from going to the Sacred Mosque tempt you to do injustice; and help one another in righteousness and piety – and do not help one another in sin and injustice – and keep fearing Allah; indeed Allah’s punishment is severe.
Forbidden for you are carrion, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of any other than Allah, and one killed by strangling, and one killed with blunt weapons, and one which died by falling, and that which was gored by the horns of some animal, and one eaten by a wild beast, except those whom you slaughter; and (also forbidden is) that which is slaughtered at the altar (of idols) and that which is distributed by the throwing of arrows (as an omen); this is an act of sin; this day, the disbelievers are in despair concerning your religion, so do not fear them and fear Me; this day have I perfected your religion for you* and completed My favour upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion; so whoever is forced by intense hunger and thirst and does not incline towards sin, then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful. (*Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the Last Prophet.)
They ask you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) what is made lawful for them; say, “Pure things are made lawful for you, and the beasts (and birds) of prey which you have trained and use for hunting, (and) you teach them what Allah has taught you; so eat what they kill and leave for you, and mention Allah’s name upon it – and keep fearing Allah; indeed Allah is Swift At Taking Account.”
This day the pure things are made lawful for you; and the food of the People given the Book(s) is lawful for you – and your food is lawful for them – and likewise are the virtuous Muslim women and the virtuous women from the people who received the Book(s) before you when you give them their bridal money – marrying them, not committing adultery nor as mistresses; and whoever turns a disbeliever after being a Muslim, all his deeds are wasted and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter.
O People who Believe! When you wish to stand up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and pass wet palms over your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles; and if you need a bath, clean yourselves thoroughly; and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you returns from answering the call of nature, or you have cohabited with women, and you do not find water, then cleanse (yourself) with clean soil – therefore stroke your soiled palms over your faces and your hands with it; Allah does not will to place you in hardship, but He wills to fully purify you and complete His favour upon you, so that you may be grateful.
And remember Allah’s favour upon you and the covenant He took from you when you said, “We hear and we obey” – and fear Allah; indeed Allah knows what lies within the hearts.
O People who Believe! Firmly establish the commands of Allah, giving testimony with justice – and do not let the enmity of anyone tempt you not to do justice; be just; that is nearer to piety – and fear Allah; indeed Allah is Well Aware of your deeds.
It is Allah’s promise to those who believe and are righteous, that for them will be forgiveness and a great reward.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs – it is they who are the people of hell.
O People who Believe! Remember Allah’s favour upon you, when a people wished to extend their hands against you, so He restrained their hands from you; and keep fearing Allah; and Muslims must rely only upon Allah.
Undoubtedly Allah made a covenant with the Descendants of Israel, and We appointed twelve chiefs among them; and Allah said, “Indeed I am with you; surely, if you establish the prayer and pay the charity, and believe in My Noble Messengers and respect* them, and lend an excellent loan to Allah, I will surely forgive your sins, and I will surely admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; then after this, if any of you disbelieves, he has certainly gone astray from the Straight Path." (To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)
So We cursed them because of them constantly breaking their covenant, and hardened their hearts; they shift the Words of Allah from their places, and have forgotten a large portion of the advices that were given to them; and you will constantly learn of deceits from them, except a few; so forgive them and excuse them; indeed Allah loves the virtuous.
And We made a covenant with those who proclaimed, “We are Christians” – they then forgot a large portion of the advices given to them; We have therefore instilled enmity and hatred between them till the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will soon inform them of what they were doing.
O People given the Book(s)! Indeed this Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) of Ours has come to you, revealing to you a lot of the things which you had hidden in the Book, and forgiving a lot of them; indeed towards you has come a light* from Allah, and a clear Book. (* The Holy Prophet is a light from Allah).
With it, Allah guides whoever obeys the will of Allah to the paths of peace, and takes them out of darkness towards light by His command, and guides them to the Straight Path.
They have indeed become disbelievers who say, “Messiah, the son of Maryam is certainly Allah”; say, “Who can then do anything against Allah, if He wills to destroy the Messiah, the son of Maryam, and his mother and everyone on earth?” And for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; He creates whatever He wills; and Allah is Able to do all things.
The Jews and the Christians said, “We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones”; say, “Why does He then punish you for your sins? In fact you are human beings, part of His creation; He forgives whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills; and for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and towards Him is the return.”
O People given the Book(s)! Indeed this Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) of Ours has come to you, revealing to you Our commands, after the Noble Messengers had stopped arriving for ages, for you might claim, “Never did any Harbinger of Glad Tidings or Herald of Warning come to us” – so this Harbinger of Glad Tidings and Herald of Warning has come to you; and Allah is Able to do all things.
And when Moosa said to his people, “O my people! Remember Allah’s favour upon you, that He created Prophets among you, and made you kings, and has now given you what He has not given to any one else in this world.”
“O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah has decreed for you and do not turn back, for you will turn back as losers.”
They said, “O Moosa! In it lives a very strong nation – and we shall never enter it, until they have gone away from there; so when they have gone away from there, we will enter it.”
So two men who were among those who feared Allah and whom Allah had favoured said, “Enter upon them by force, through the gate; if you enter the gate, victory will be yours; and depend only upon Allah, if you have faith.”
They said, “O Moosa! We will never enter it whilst they are there, so you and your Lord go and fight – we shall remain seated here.”
Said Moosa, “My Lord! I have no control except over myself and my brother, so keep us separated from the disobedient nation.” (Do not count us among them).
Said Allah, “The (holy) land is therefore forbidden for them for forty years; they will wander in the earth; so do not grieve for these disobedient people.”
And recite to them the true tale of the two sons of Adam; when both of them offered a sacrifice each – hence the sacrifice of one was accepted and not accepted from the other; he (the other) said, “I swear I will kill you”; he answered, “Allah accepts only from the pious.”
“Indeed, if you do extend your hand against me to kill me, I will not extend my hand against you to kill you; I fear Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
“I only desire that you alone should bear my sin and your own sin – hence you become of the people of hell; and that is the proper punishment of the unjust.”
So his soul incited him to kill his brother – he therefore killed him, and was therefore ruined.
So Allah sent a crow scratching the ground, to show him how to hide his brother’s corpse; he said, “Woe to me! I was not even capable enough to be like this crow, so I would hide my brother’s corpse”; and he turned remorseful.
For this reason; We decreed for the Descendants of Israel that whoever kills a human being except in lieu of killing or causing turmoil in the earth, so it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and whoever saves the life of one person, is as if he had saved the life of all mankind; and undoubtedly Our Noble Messengers came to them with clear proofs – then after this indeed many of them are oppressors in the earth.
The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His Noble Messenger and cause turmoil in the land is that they be all be killed or crucified, or their hands and feet cut off from alternate sides, or they be banished far away from the land; this is their degradation in the world, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.
Except those who repent before you apprehend them; so know well that Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah, and seek the means towards Him, and strive in His cause, in the hope of attaining success.
Indeed if the disbelievers owned all that is in the earth and a similar one in addition to it, and they offered it as a ransom to save themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them; and for them is a painful punishment.
They will wish to come out of hell, and will not come out of it – and for them is an unending punishment.
And cut off the hands of those men or women who are thieves – a recompense of their deeds, a punishment from Allah; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
So if one repents after his wrongdoing and reforms himself, Allah will incline towards him with His mercy; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do you not know that to Allah only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whomever He wills, and forgives whomever He wills; and Allah is Able to do all things.
O Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! Do not let yourself be aggrieved by the people who rush towards disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe” but whose hearts are not Muslims; and some Jews; they listen a great deal to falsehood, and to other people who do not come to you; shifting Allah’s Words from their correct places; and say, “If this command is given to you, obey it, but if this is not given to you, then refrain”; and the one whom Allah wills to send astray, you will never be able to help him in the least against Allah; they are those whose hearts Allah did not will to cleanse; for them is disgrace in this world, and for them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.
The excessively eager listeners of falsehood, extreme devourers of the forbidden; so if they come humbly to you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), judge between them or shun them; and if you turn away from them they cannot harm you at all; and if you do judge between them, judge with fairness; indeed Allah loves the equitable.
And why should they wish to be judged by you, when they have the Taurat with them, in which exist the commands of Allah and yet they turn away from it? And they will not accept faith.
Undoubtedly We sent down the Taurat, in which is guidance and light; the Jews were commanded according to it by Our obedient Prophets, and the rabbis and the religious jurists for they were commanded to protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it; so do not fear men, and fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for an abject price; and whoever does not judge according to what is sent down by Allah – it is they who are disbelievers.
And in the Taurat, We made it obligatory upon them that, “A life (is the retribution) for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds is a retribution”; then whoever willingly agrees to retribution, it shall redeem him of his sin; and whoever does not judge according to what is sent down by Allah – it is they who are the unjust.
And We brought Eisa the son of Maryam, following the footsteps of those Prophets, confirming the Taurat which preceded him – and We bestowed upon him the Injeel (Bible) in which is guidance and light, and confirms the Taurat which preceded it, and a guidance and an advice to the pious.
And the People of Injeel must judge by what Allah has sent down in it; and whoever does not judge according to what is sent down by Allah – it is they who are the sinners.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) We have sent down the true Book upon you, confirming the Books preceding it, and a protector and witness over them – therefore judge between them according to what is sent down by Allah, and O listener, do not follow their desires, abandoning the truth which has come to you; We have appointed for you all, a separate (religious) law and a way; and had Allah willed He could have made you one nation, but the purpose (His will) is to test you by what He has given you, therefore seek to surpass one another in good deeds; towards Allah only you will all return, so He will inform you concerning the matter in which you disputed.
And therefore, O Muslims, judge between them according to what is sent down by Allah, and do not follow their desires, and be cautious of them so that they may not divert you from some commands which have been sent down to you; then if they turn away, know that Allah’s will is to punish them for some of their sins; and indeed many men are disobedient.
So do they wish a judgement of ignorance? And whose judgement is better than that of Allah, for the people who are certain?
O People who Believe! Do not make the Jews and the Christians your friends; they are friends of one another; and whoever among you befriends them, is one of them; indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.
You will now see those in whose hearts is a disease, that they rush towards the Jews and the Christians, saying, “We fear that a misfortune will possibly befall us”; so it is likely that Allah may soon bring victory, or a command from Himself, so they will remain regretting what they had hidden in their hearts.
And the believers say, “Are these the ones who swore by Allah most vehemently in their oaths, that they are with you?” All their deeds are destroyed, so they are ruined.
O People who Believe! Whoever among you reneges from his religion, so Allah will soon bring a people who are His beloved ones and Allah is their beloved, lenient with the Muslims and stern towards disbelievers – they will strive in Allah’s cause, and not fear the criticism of any accuser; this is Allah’s munificence, He may give to whomever He wills; and Allah is the Most Capable, the All Knowing.
You do not have any friends except Allah and His Noble Messenger and the believers who establish the prayer and pay the charity, and are bowed down before Allah.
And whoever takes Allah and His Noble Messenger and the Muslims as friends – so undoubtedly only the party of Allah is victorious.
O People who Believe! Those who have made your religion a mockery and a sport, and those who received the Book before you, and the disbelievers – do not befriend any of them; and keep fearing Allah, if you have faith.
And when you call to prayer, they mock and make fun of it; this is because they are people without any sense.
Say, “O People given the Book(s)! What do you dislike in us – except that we believe in Allah and what is sent down to us and what was sent down before, and because most of you are disobedient?”
Say, “Shall I tell you of those who are in a worse position than this, in Allah’s sight? It is those whom Allah has cursed and has wreaked His wrath upon and turned some of them into apes and swine, and worshippers of the devil; theirs is a worse destination and they have wandered further astray from the Straight Path.”
And when they come to you, they say, “We are Muslims” whereas they were disbelievers when they came in, and disbelievers when they went out; and Allah knows very well, what they hide.
And you will see many of them rushing towards sin and oppression, and to devour the forbidden; undoubtedly what they do is extremely evil.
Why do not their priests and monks forbid them from speaking evil and devouring the forbidden? Undoubtedly what they do is extremely evil.
And the Jews said, “Allah’s hand is tied"; may their hands be tied – and they are accursed for saying so! In fact, both His hands* are free, He bestows upon whomever He wills; and O dear Prophet, this Book which has been sent down upon you from your Lord will cause many of them to advance in their rebellion and disbelief; and We have instilled enmity and hatred between them till the Day of Resurrection; whenever they ignite the flame of war, Allah extinguishes it, and they strive to create chaos in the land; and Allah does not love the mischievous. (* This is a metaphor used to express Allah’s power).
If the People given the Book(s) had accepted faith and been pious, We would have certainly redeemed them of their sins and would have certainly taken them into serene Gardens.
And had they kept the Taurat and the Injeel established, and what was sent down towards them from their Lord, they would have received sustenance from above and from beneath their feet; among them is a group who is fair; but most of them commit extremely evil deeds.
O Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! Convey all what has been sent down upon you from your Lord; and if you do not, then you have not conveyed any of His messages; and Allah will protect you from the people; indeed Allah does not guide the disbelievers.
Say, “O People given the Book(s)! You are nothing until you establish the Taurat and the Injeel, and what was sent down towards you from your Lord”; and this Book which has been sent down upon you from your Lord will cause many of them to advance in their rebellion and disbelief; so do not at all grieve for the disbelievers.
Indeed those who call themselves Muslims – and similarly among the Jews, and the Sabeans, and the Christians* – whoever sincerely accepts faith in Allah and the Last Day, and does good deeds – so there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve. (Whoever among them converts to Islam).
We made a covenant with the Descendants of Israel and sent Noble Messengers towards them; whenever a Noble Messenger came to them with whatever was not according to their own desires, they denied some of them and some they slew.
And they assumed that there will be no punishment, so they turned blind and deaf – then Allah accepted their penance, then again many of them turned blind and deaf; and Allah is seeing their deeds.
They are certainly disbelievers who say, “Allah is actually the Messiah, the son of Maryam”; whereas the Messiah had said, “O Descendants of Israel, worship Allah Who is my Lord and (also) your Lord”; undoubtedly whoever ascribes partners with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him; his destination is hell; and the unjust do not have any supporters.
They are certainly disbelievers who say, “Indeed Allah is the third of the three Gods”; whereas there is no God except the One God; and if they do not desist from their speech, undoubtedly a painful punishment will reach those among them who die as disbelievers.
So why do they not incline towards Allah and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The Messiah, the son of Maryam, is purely a Noble Messenger; many Noble Messengers have passed before him; and his mother is a truthful woman; they both used to eat food; see how We make the signs clear for them, and see how they turn away!
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What! You worship, other than Allah, that which is neither the controller of your losses nor of your benefits? And Allah only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.”
Say, “O People given the Book(s)! Do not wrongfully commit injustice in your religion, and do not follow the people who earlier went astray, and led many others astray, and wandered away from the Straight Path.”
Those among the Descendants of Israel who turned disbelievers were cursed by the tongue of Dawud, and of Eisa the son of Maryam; it was because of their disobedience and their rebellion.
They did not restrain one another from the evil they used to do; undoubtedly they used to commit extremely evil deeds.
You will see that many of them make friends with the disbelievers; what an evil thing they had sent ahead for themselves, for Allah’s wrath came upon them and they will remain in the punishment, forever.
Had they believed in Allah and this Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and what is sent down upon him, they would not befriend the disbelievers, but most of them are disobedient.
You will certainly find the Jews and the polytheists as the greatest enemies of the Muslims; and you will find the closest in friendship to the Muslims those who said, “We are Christians”; that is because scholars and monks are among them, and they are not proud.
And when they listen to what has been sent down to the Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), you observe their eyes overflowing with tears because they have recognised the truth; they say, “Our Lord, we have accepted faith – therefore record us among the witnesses of the truth.”
“And what is the matter with us, that we should not believe in Allah and this truth which has come to us? And we hope that our Lord will admit us along with the righteous.”
So because of their saying, Allah bestowed them with Gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide forever; and this is the reward of the virtuous.
And those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, are the people of hell.
O People who Believe! Do not forbid the pure things, which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not cross the limits; indeed Allah dislikes the transgressors.
Eat of the sustenance which Allah has given you, the lawful and the pure – and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
Allah does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but He does take you to task for oaths which you ratify; so the redemption of such oaths is to provide food to ten needy persons equal to the average of what you feed your family, or to clothe them, or to free one slave; and for one who has no means, is the fasting for three days; this is the redemption of your oaths when you have sworn; and fulfil your oaths; this is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may be thankful.
O People who Believe! Wine (all intoxicants), and gambling, and idols, and the darts are impure – the works of Satan, therefore keep avoiding them so that you may succeed.
The devil only seeks to instil hatred and enmity between you with wine and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer; so have you desisted?
And obey Allah and obey the Noble Messenger, and be cautious; then if you turn away, so know that the duty of Our Noble Messenger is only to plainly convey the message.
Upon those who accepted faith and did good deeds, there shall be no sin for whatever they have consumed in the past, provided they fear and continue to believe and do good deeds, then again fear and continue to believe, and then again fear and remain virtuous; and Allah loves the virtuous.
O People who Believe! Allah will surely test you with some prey that is within reach of your hands and your spears, so that Allah may make known those who fear Him without seeing; so henceforth, a painful punishment is for anyone who transgresses.
O People who Believe! Do not kill prey while you are on the pilgrimage; and whoever among you kills it intentionally, so its recompense is that he shall give a similar domestic animal (for sacrifice), two honest men among you rendering the command, the sacrifice being brought to the Kaa’bah – or he gives as redemption, food for some needy persons, or fasts for the same number of days, so that he may taste the consequences of his deed; Allah has forgiven what has passed; and henceforth whoever does it, Allah will take recompense from him; and Allah is Almighty, Avenger.
It is lawful for you to hunt from the sea and to eat from it, for your benefit and that of the travellers; and hunting on land is forbidden for you while you are on the pilgrimage; and fear Allah, towards Whom you will arise.
Allah has made the Kaa’bah, the respected house, a cause for peoples survival, and the Sacred Month, and the sacrifices in the holy land, and the garlanded animals; this is so that you may be convinced that Allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth, and that Allah is the All Knowing.
Know well that Allah’s punishment is severe, and that Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
There is no duty upon the Noble Messenger except to convey the command; and Allah knows all what you disclose and all what you hide.
Say, “The impure (evil) and the pure (good) are not equal, even though the abundance of the impure may attract you; therefore keep fearing Allah, O men of intellect, so that you may succeed.”
O People who Believe! Do not ask about matters which, if disclosed to you, would be disliked by you; and if you ask about them while the Qur’an is being sent down, they will be disclosed to you; Allah has forgiven these; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
A nation before you asked about such matters and then disbelieved in them.
Allah has not appointed (commanded to sacrifice) the camel with ears sliced (Bahira) or the she-camel (Saibah) or the she-goat (Wasilah) or the breeding camel (Hami), but the disbelievers fabricate lies against Allah; and most of them do not have any sense at all.
And when it is said to them, “Come towards what Allah has sent down and towards the Noble Messenger”, they say, “Sufficient for us is what we found our forefathers upon”; even if their forefathers did not have knowledge nor had guidance?
O People who Believe! Fear for your own souls; he who has strayed cannot harm you in the least if you are on guidance; towards Allah only you will all return – He will then inform you of what you used to do.
O People who Believe! The witnesses between you when death approaches any one of you, at the time of making a will, should be two reliable men from among you, or two from another tribe in case you are travelling in the land and the event of death approaches you; engage them after the prayers, and if you doubt, they must swear by Allah that, “We shall not exchange our oaths for any price even if he is a near relative, nor will we hide the testimony of Allah – if we do, then surely we are of the sinners.”
Then if it is later known that both of them committed sin, two others may take their place, from those who were caused the most harm by the false testimony, and they must swear by Allah that, “Our testimony is more accurate than the testimony of these two, and we have not exceeded the limits – if we do, then surely we shall be of the unjust.”
This is more suitable than their bearing testimony as they wish or fear that some oaths may be made void, after their taking oath; so fear Allah and heed the commands; and Allah does not guide the disobedient.
On the day when Allah will gather all the Noble Messengers, and then say, “What response did you get?” They will submit, “We do not have any knowledge; indeed it is only You, Who knows all the hidden.”
When Allah will say, “O Eisa, the son of Maryam! Remember My favour upon you and your mother; when I supported you with the Holy Spirit; you were speaking to people from the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you the Book and wisdom and the Taurat and the Injeel; and when you used to mould a birdlike sculpture from clay, by My command, and blow into it – so it (the living bird) used to fly by My command, and you used to cure him who was born blind and cure the leper, by My command; and when you used to raise up the dead, by My command; and when I restrained the Descendants of Israel against you when you came to them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said, ‘This is nothing but clear magic’.”
“And when I inspired into the hearts of the disciples that, ‘Believe in Me and in My Noble Messenger’; they said, ‘We accept faith, and be witness that we are Muslims.’”
When the disciples said, “O Eisa, the son of Maryam! Will your Lord send down a table spread (with food) for us from heaven?” He said, “Fear Allah, if you are believers.”
They said, “We wish to eat from it and so that our hearts be convinced and to see that you have spoken the truth to us, and that we may be witnesses upon it.”
Eisa, the son of Maryam, said, “O Allah, O our Lord! Send down to us a table spread from heaven, so that it may become a day of celebration for us – for our former and latter people – and a sign from You; and give us sustenance – and You are the Best Provider Of Sustenance.”
Said Allah, “Indeed I shall send it down to you; so thereafter whoever disbelieves amongst you – I will surely mete out to him a punishment with which I shall not punish anyone else in the whole world.”
And when Allah will say, “O Eisa, the son of Maryam! Did you say to the people, ‘Appoint me and my mother as two Gods, besides Allah’?” He will submit, “Purity is to You! It is not proper for me to say something for which I do not have a right; if I have said it, then surely You know it; You know what lies in my heart, and I do not know what is in Your knowledge; indeed You only know all the hidden.”
“I have not told them except what You commanded me, that ‘Worship Allah, Who is my Lord and is also your Lord’; I was aware of them till I was among them; and when You raised me, only You watched over them; and all things are present before You.”
“If you punish them, then indeed they are Your slaves; and if you forgive them, then indeed You only are the Almighty, the Wise.”
Proclaimed Allah, “This is a day on which the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness; for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide for ever and ever; Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah; this is the greatest success.”
To Allah only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them: and He is Able to do all things.
