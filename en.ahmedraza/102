The craving for excess wealth kept you people neglectful.
Until you confronted the graves.
Yes certainly, you will soon realise!
Again, yes certainly, you will soon realise!
Yes certainly, if you had believed with certainty, you would not have craved for wealth.
Indeed you will see hell.
Again, indeed you will see it with certainty.
Then, on that day, you will surely be questioned regarding the favours.
