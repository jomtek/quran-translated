All whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah, the King, the Most Pure, the Most Honourable, the Wise.
It is He Who has sent among the unlettered people a Noble Messenger from themselves, who recites His verses to them and purifies them, and bestows them the knowledge of the Book and wisdom; and indeed before this, they were in open error.
And he (the Holy Prophet) bestows knowledge to others along with them, who have not yet joined them; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
This is Allah’s munificence, which He may give to whomever He wills; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
The example of those who were entrusted with the Taurat, and did not carry out its commands, is like the donkey carrying books; what a wretched example is of the people who denied the signs of Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust.
Say “O Jews! If you assume that you are Allah’s friends, others are not, then wish for death if you are truthful!”
And they will never wish for it because of the misdeeds their hands have sent ahead; and Allah well knows the unjust.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Indeed death which you run away from will surely confront you, then you will be returned to Him Who knows all the hidden and the visible – He will then inform you of what you did.”
O People who Believe! When the call for prayer is given on (Friday) the day of congregation, rush towards the remembrance of Allah and stop buying and selling; this is better for you if you understand.
And when the prayer ends, spread out in the land and seek Allah’s munificence, and profusely remember Allah, in the hope of attaining success.
And when they see some trade or sport, they move towards it and leave you standing delivering the sermon; proclaim, “That which is with Allah, is better than sport and trade; and the sustenance of Allah is the best.”
