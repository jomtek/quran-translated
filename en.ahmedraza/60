O People who Believe! Do not befriend My and your enemy – you reveal secrets to them out of friendship whereas they disbelieve in the truth which has come to you! It is they who remove the Noble Messenger and you from your homes, upon your believing in Allah, your Lord; if you have come out to fight for My cause, and to gain My pleasure, then do not befriend them; you send them secret messages of friendship – and I well know all what you hide and all what you disclose; and whoever among you does it, has indeed strayed away from the right path.
If they gain dominance over you they will be your enemies, and will extend their hands and their tongues towards you with evil, and they wish that in some way you turn disbelievers.
Neither your relations nor your offspring will in the least benefit you, on the Day of Resurrection; He will separate you from them; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
Indeed in Ibrahim, and those along with him, lay a good example for you follow – when they said to their people, “Indeed we are unconcerned with you and all what you worship besides Allah; we reject you, and between us and you has surfaced enmity and hatred for ever until you accept faith in the One Allah” – except the saying of Ibrahim to his father, “I will surely seek forgiveness for you, and I do not possess any power to benefit you against Allah”; “O our Lord! We have relied only upon You, and towards You only we have inclined and only towards You is the return”.
“O our Lord! Do not put us into the trial of the disbelievers, and forgive us, O our Lord! Indeed You only are the Most Honourable, the Wise.”
Indeed in them lay a good example for you to follow – for one who looks forward to (meeting) Allah and the Last Day; and whoever turns away – then (know that) indeed Allah only is the Independent, the Most Praiseworthy.
It is likely that Allah may create friendship between you and those among them who are now your enemies; and Allah is All Able; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah does not forbid you from those who did not fight against you because of religion and did not drive you out from your homes, that you should be kind towards them and deal with them fairly; indeed the equitable are the beloved of Allah.
Allah forbids you only from those who fought against you because of religion or drove you out from your homes or helped others to drive you out, that you should befriend them; and whoever befriends them – it is they who are the unjust.
O People who Believe! When Muslim women leave the lands of disbelief and migrate towards you, examine them; Allah knows more about their faith; so if you judge the women to be believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers; neither are they lawful for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful for them; and give their disbelieving husbands what they had spent; and there is no sin upon you to marry them if you give them their bridal money; and do not continue the marriage with disbelieving women – and ask for what you had spent, and the disbelievers may ask for what they had spent; this is Allah’s command; He judges between you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And if some women go away from the Muslims to the disbelievers – then when you punish the disbelievers, give from the war booty to the Muslims who lost their wives the amount they had spent; and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! If Muslim women come humbly to you to take oath of allegiance that they will neither ascribe any partner to Allah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor bring the lie that they carry between their hands and feet, nor disobey you in any rightful matter – then accept their allegiance and seek forgiveness from Allah for them; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Do not befriend the people upon whom is Allah’s wrath – they have lost hope in the Hereafter the way the disbelievers have lost hope in the people of the graves.
