Read with the name of your Lord Who created,
Created man from a clot.
Read, and your Lord only is the Most Beneficent,
The One Who taught to write with the pen.
The One Who taught man all what he did not know.
Yes indeed, man is surely rebellious.
As he considers himself independent!
Indeed towards your Lord only is the return.
What is your opinion – regarding him who forbids –
A bondman when he offers the prayer?
What is your opinion – if he were upon guidance,
He would enjoin piety, so how good it would be!
What is your opinion – if he denies and turns away, how wretched will be his state!
Did he not realise that Allah is watching?
Yes certainly, if he does not desist, We will seize him by the forelock.
A forelock that lies, is sinful.
So let him now call his gang!
We will now call the guards!
Yes indeed; do not listen to him – and prostrate, and become close to Us. (Command of Prostration # 14)
