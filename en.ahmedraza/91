By oath of the sun and its light
And by oath of the moon when it follows the sun
And by oath of the day when it reveals it
And by oath of the night when it hides it
And by oath of the heaven and by oath of Him Who made it.
And by oath of the earth and by oath of Him Who spread it.
And by oath of the soul and by oath of Him Who made it proper.
And inspired in it the knowledge of its sins and its piety.
Indeed successful is the one who made it pure.
And indeed failed is the one who covered it in sin.
The tribe of Thamud denied with rebellion.
When the most wicked among them stood up in defiance.
So the Noble Messenger of Allah said to them, “Stay away from the she camel of Allah, and from its turn to drink.”
In response they belied him, and hamstrung the she camel – so Allah put ruin over them because of their sins and flattened their dwellings.
And He does not fear its coming behind (to take vengeance).
