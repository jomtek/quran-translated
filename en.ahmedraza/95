By oath of the fig and of the olive,
And by oath of Mount Sinai,
And by oath of this secure land,
We have indeed created man in the best shape.
We then turned him towards all the lowest of the low states.
Except those who accepted faith and did good deeds â€“ for them is a never ending reward.
So after this, what causes you to deny the judgement?
Is not Allah the Greatest Judge upon all judges?
