All praise is to Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and has created darkness and light; yet the disbelievers appoint equals (false deities) to their Lord!
It is He Who has created you from clay, and then decreed a term for you; and it is a fixed promise before Him, yet you still doubt!
And He is Allah (the God) of the heavens and in the earth; He knows all, your secrets and your disclosures, and He knows your deeds.
And never does a sign come to them from among the signs of Allah, except that they* turn away from it. (* The disbelievers)
So indeed they denied the truth* when it came to them; so now the tidings of the thing they used to mock at, will come to them. (Prophet Mohammed -peace and blessings be upon him, or the Holy Qur’an).
Do they not see how many civilisations We destroyed before them, whom We had established more firmly in the earth than We have established you, and We sent on them abundant rain from the sky, and made the rivers flow beneath them? So we destroyed them because of their sins, and created another civilisation after them.
And had We sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) something written on paper so that they could feel it with their hands, even then the disbelievers would have said, “This is nothing but clear magic.”
And they said, “Why has not an angel been sent down to him?” And had We sent down an angel, then the matter would have been finished, and they would not get any respite.
And had we appointed an angel as a Prophet, We would still have made him as a man and would keep them in the same doubt, as they are now in.
And certainly, O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) the Noble Messengers before you have also been mocked at, so those who laughed at them were themselves ruined by their own mocking.
Proclaim, “Travel in the land, and see what sort of fate befell those who denied.”
Say, “To Whom does all whatever is in the heavens and the earth, belong?” Proclaim, “To Allah”; He has made mercy obligatory upon His grace; undoubtedly, He will surely gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt; those who put their souls to ruin, do not accept faith.
And to Him only belongs all whatever exists in the night and in the day; and He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Say, “Shall I choose as a supporter someone other than Allah, Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth and Who feeds and does not need to eat?” Say, “I have been ordered to be the first to submit myself (to Him), and O people, do not be of the polytheists.”
Say, “If I disobey my Lord, I then fear the punishment of the Great Day (of Resurrection).”
Indeed Allah’s mercy has been upon him, from whom the punishment has been averted on that Day; and this is the clear success.
And if Allah afflicts you with some misfortune, then there is none who can remove it, except Him; and if He sends you some good fortune, then (know that) He is Able to do all things.
He is the Omnipotent over His bondmen; and He is the Wise, the Aware.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Whose testimony is the greatest?” Say, “Allah is the Witness between me and you; and this Qur’an has been sent down upon me, so I may warn you with it and whomever it may reach; so do you bear witness that there are other Gods along with Allah?” Say, “I do not bear witness to it”; Say, “He is the only One God and I do not have any relation with whatever you ascribe as partners (to Him).”
The people to whom We gave the Book(s) recognise this Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as they recognise their own sons; those who put their own souls to ruin, do not accept faith.
And who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah or denies His signs? Undoubtedly, the unjust will never succeed.
And on the day when We will resurrect everyone together, then say to the polytheists, “Where are those partners (your false deities) whom you professed?”
Then they had no fabrication except that they said, “By Allah, our Lord, we were never polytheists!”
Observe how they lied against themselves, and how they lost the things they fabricated!
And among them is one who listens to you; and We have put covers upon their hearts so they may not understand it, and deafness in their ears; and (even) if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them; to the extent that when they come to you to debate with you, the disbelievers say, “This is nothing but stories of former people.”
And they stop (others) from it and run away from it; and they ruin none except themselves, and they do not have sense.
And if you see them when they will be placed above hell, they will say, “Alas, if only we might be sent back and not deny the signs of our Lord, and become Muslims!”
In fact it has become clear to them what they used to hide before; and were they to be sent back, they would commit the same which they were forbidden to, and undoubtedly they are liars.
And they said, “There is no other life except our life of this world, and we are not to be raised.”
And if you see when they are placed before their Lord, He will say, “Is this not real (the truth)? They will say, “Yes – why not, by our Lord!” He will say, “So now taste the punishment – the recompense of your disbelief.”
Those who denied their meeting with Allah, have indeed failed; to the extent that when the Last Day suddenly came upon them they said, “Woe to us that we failed to believe in it” – and they carry their burdens on their backs; what an evil burden they carry!
The life of this world is nothing except a pastime and sport; and undoubtedly the abode of the Hereafter is better for the pious; so do you not have sense?
We know well that their statement grieves you – so they do not deny you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) but in fact the unjust deny the signs of Allah.
And indeed Noble Messengers have been denied before you, so they patiently bore the denial and torture till Our help reached them; and there is none to alter the decisions of Allah; and the news of the Noble Messengers have already reached you.
And if their turning away has grieved you, then if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth or a ladder into the sky to bring a sign for them; and if Allah willed, He could have brought them all together upon guidance, so O listener (followers of this Prophet) do not ever be of the ignorant.
It is only those who hear (with sincere hearts) that accept faith; and Allah will raise these people dead of heart, then towards Him they will be herded.
And they said, “Why has no sign been sent down upon him from his Lord?” Say, “Indeed Allah is Able to send down a sign”, but most of them are totally ignorant.
And there is not an animal moving in the earth nor a bird flying on its wings, but they are a nation like you; We have left out nothing in this Book – then towards their Lord they will be raised.
And those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb in realms of darkness; Allah may send astray whomever He wills; and may place on the Straight Path whomever He wills.
Say, “What is your opinion – if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the Hour arrives, will you call upon anyone (deity) besides Allah; if you are truthful?”
“In fact you will only call upon Him, and if He wills, He may remove that because of which you prayed to Him, and you will forget the partners (you ascribe to Him).”
And We have indeed sent Noble Messengers towards the nations that were before you – We therefore seized them with hardship and adversity so that, in some way, they may humbly plead.
So why did they not humbly plead when Our punishment came to them? But their hearts were hardened and the devil made all their deeds appear good to them!
So when they forgot the advices made to them, We opened the gates of all things for them; to the extent that when they were rejoicing for what they had received, We seized them suddenly, hence they remained dejected.
The origins of the unjust people were therefore cut off; and all praise is to Allah, Lord Of The Creation.
Say, “What is your opinion – if Allah were to take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts, then is there a God besides Allah who could restore it for you?” Observe how We explain the verses to them, yet they turn away!
Say, “What is your opinion – if the punishment of Allah were to come upon you suddenly or openly (with forewarning), who would be destroyed except the disbelieving people?”
And We did not send Noble Messengers except as Heralds of glad tidings and warnings; so upon those who accept faith and reform themselves, shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.
And those who deny Our signs – the punishment will afflict them for their disobedience.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I say that I gain knowledge of the hidden on my own, nor do I say to you that I am an angel; I only follow what is divinely revealed to me”; say, “Will the blind and the sighted ever be equal? So do you not think?”
And with this Qur’an warn those who fear, that they will be raised towards their Lord in a state when, except Allah, there will be no protector for them nor an intercessor, so that they may be pious.
And do not repel those who call upon their Lord in the morning and evening, seeking His pleasure; you are not responsible for their account nor are they responsible for your account – then your repelling them would be far from justice.
And similarly We have made some as a trial for others – that the wealthy disbelievers upon seeing the needy Muslims say, “Are these whom Allah has favoured among us?” Does not Allah recognise those who are thankful?
And when those who believe in Our signs come humbly in your presence, say to them, “Peace be upon you – your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself by His grace – that whoever among you commits a sin by folly and thereafter repents and reforms (himself), then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And this is how We explain Our verses clearly and so that the way of the criminals become well exposed.
Say, “I have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship other than Allah”; say, “I do not follow your desires – if it were, I would then go astray and not be on the right path.”
Say, “I am on the clear proof from my Lord, whereas you deny Him; I do not have what you are impatient for; there is no command except that of Allah; He states the truth and He is the Best of Judges."
Say, “If I had the thing for which you are impatient, then the matter between me and you would have already been decided”; and Allah is Well Aware of the unjust.
And it is He Who has the keys of the hidden – only He knows them; and He knows all that is in the land and the sea; and no leaf falls but He knows it – and there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything wet or dry, which is not recorded in a clear Book.
And it is He Who removes your souls at night (while asleep) and knows whatever you commit by day; then He raises you again during the day, to complete the term appointed (for you); then it is to Him that you are to return – He will then inform you of what you used to do.
And He is Omnipotent over His bondmen and sends guardians over you; to the extent that when death comes to one of you, Our angels remove his soul, and they do not err.
They (the souls) are then returned towards their True Lord – Allah; pay heed! Only His is the command; and He is the Swiftest At Taking Account.
Say, “Who rescues you from the calamities of the land and the sea – Whom you call upon crying loudly and in whispers that, ‘If we are saved from this we will surely be grateful’?”
Say, “Allah delivers you from these and from all distresses – yet you ascribe partners to Him!”
Say, “He is Able to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to cause you to fight each other by dividing you into different groups, and make you taste the harshness of one another”; observe how We explain the verses so that they may understand.
And your people (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) denied it whereas this is undoubtedly the truth; say, “I am not responsible for you.”
All matters have a fixed time and soon you will come to know.
And O listener (followers of this Prophet) when you see those who argue in Our verses, turn away from them until they engage in another topic; and if the devil causes you to forget, then do not sit with the unjust after remembering.
And the pious are not accountable for them in the least, apart from the giving of advice so that they may avoid.
And forsake those who have made their religion a mockery and play, and whom the worldly life has deceived – and advise them with this Qur’an so that a soul may not be seized for what it earns; other than Allah it will not have a protector nor an intercessor; and if it offers every recompense in exchange for itself, it will not be accepted from it; these are the ones who are seized for their own deeds; for them is boiling water to drink and a painful punishment, as a recompense of their disbelief. (The disbelievers will not have any intercessors.)
Say, “Shall we worship, other than Allah, that which neither benefits us nor harms us, and (therefore) be turned back after Allah has guided us, like one whom the devils have led astray in the earth – bewildered?; his companions call him to the path (saying), ‘Come here’”; say, “Indeed only the guidance of Allah is (the true) guidance; and we are commanded to submit to the Lord Of The Creation.”
“And to keep the (obligatory) prayer established and to fear Him; and it is to Him that you are to be raised.”
And it is He Who perfectly created the heavens and the earth; and when He will say “Be” on the Day (of resurrection) to all the extinct things, it will happen immediately; His Word is true; and it will be His kingship on the day when the Trumpet is blown; All Knowing of all the hidden and the revealed; and He only is the Wise, the Aware.
And remember when Ibrahim said to his father (paternal uncle) Azar, “What! You appoint idols as Gods? Indeed I find you and your people in open error.” (Prophet Ibrahim was rightly guided since birth).
And likewise We showed Ibrahim the entire kingdom of the heavens and the earth and so that he be of those who believe as eyewitnesses.
So when the night became dark upon him he saw a star; he said (to Azar / the people), “(You portray that) this is my Lord?”; then when it set he said, “I do not like the things that set.”
Then when he saw the moon shining, he said, “(You proclaim that) this is my Lord?”; then when it set, he said, “If my Lord had not guided me*, I too would be one of these astray people.” (* Prophet Ibrahim was rightly guided before this event).
Then when he saw the sun shining brightly, he said, “(You say that) this is my Lord? This is the biggest of them all!”; then when it set he said, “O people! I do not have any relation with the whatever you ascribe as partners (to Him).”
“I have directed my attention towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, am devoted solely to Him, and am not of the polytheists.”
And his people argued with him; he said, “What! You dispute with me concerning Allah? So He has guided me; and I do not have any fear of whatever you ascribe as partners, except what my Lord wills (to happen); my Lord’s knowledge encompasses all things; so will you not accept advice?”
“And how should I fear whatever you ascribe as partners, whilst you do not fear that you have ascribed partners to Allah – for which He has not sent down on you any proof? So which of the two groups has more right to refuge, if you know?”
Those who believed and did not mix it with injustice (disbelief), the refuge is only for them, and only they are on guidance.
And this is Our argument, which We gave Ibrahim against his people; We raise to high ranks whomever We will; indeed your Lord is Wise, All Knowing.
And We bestowed upon him Ishaq (Isaac) and Yaqub (Jacob); We guided all of them; and We guided Nooh before them and of his descendants, Dawud and Sulaiman and Ayyub and Yusuf and Moosa and Haroon; and this is the way We reward the virtuous.
And (We guided) Zakaria and Yahya (John) and Eisa and Elias; all these are worthy of Our proximity.
And Ismael (Ishmael) and Yasa’a (Elisha) and Yunus (Jonah) and Lut (Lot); and to each one during their times, We gave excellence over all others.
And some of their ancestors and their descendants and their brothers; and We chose them and guided them to the Straight Path.
This is the guidance of Allah, which He may give to whomever He wills among His bondmen; and had they ascribed partners (to Allah), their deeds would have been wasted.
These are the ones whom We gave the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood; so if these people do not believe in it, We have then kept ready for it a nation who do not reject (the truth).
These are the ones whom Allah guided, so follow their guidance; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not ask from you any fee for the Qur’an; it is nothing but an advice to the entire world.”
And they (the Jews) did not realise (or appreciate) the importance of Allah as was required when they said, “Allah has not sent down anything upon any human being”; say, “Who has sent down the Book which Moosa brought, a light and guidance for mankind, which you have divided into different papers, some which you show and hide most of them? And (by which) you are taught what you did not know nor did your forefathers?” Say, “Allah” – then leave them playing in their indecency.
And this is the blessed Book which We have sent down, confirming the Books preceding it, and in order that you may warn the leader of all villages and all those around it in the entire world; and those who believe in the Hereafter accept faith in this Book, and guard their prayers.
Who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah or says, “I have received divine inspiration”, whereas he has not been inspired at all – and one who says, “I will now reveal something similar to what Allah has sent down”? And if you see when the unjust are in the throes of death and the angels are with their hands outstretched; (saying) “Surrender your souls; this day you shall be given a disgraceful punishment – the recompense of your fabricating lies against Allah, and your scorning His signs.”
“And indeed you (the disbelievers) have now come to Us alone as We had created you at first, and you have left behind you all the wealth and riches We had bestowed upon you; and We do not see your intercessors along with you, whom you claimed to possess a share in you; indeed the link between yourselves is cut off, and you have lost all what you contended.”
Indeed it is Allah Who splits the grain and the seed; it is He Who brings forth living from the dead, and it is He Who brings forth dead from the living; such is Allah; so where are you reverting?
It is He Who breaks dawn (by splitting the dark); and He has made the night a calmness, and the sun and the moon a count (for time); this is the command set by the Almighty, the All Knowing.
And it is He Who has created the stars for you, so that you may find your way by them in the darkness of the land and the sea; indeed We have explained Our verses in detail for the people of knowledge.
And it is He Who has created you from a single soul – then you have to stop over* in one place and stay entrusted** in another; indeed We have explained Our verses in detail for people of understanding. (* This earth. ** The grave.)
And it is He Who sends down water from the sky; so with it We produced all things that grow; hence We produce from it vegetation from which We bring forth grains in clusters; and from the pollen of dates, dense bunches – and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, similar in some ways and unlike in some; look at its fruit when it bears yield, and its ripening; indeed in it are signs for the people who believe.
And out of sheer ignorance they have ascribed jinns as partners of Allah, whereas it is He Who created them, and they have invented sons and daughters for Him! Purity and Supremacy is to Him, from all what they ascribe.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; how can He possibly have a child when, in fact, He does not have a spouse? And He has created all things; and He knows everything.
Such is Allah, your Lord; and none is worthy of worship except Him; the Creator of all things – therefore worship Him; and He is the Trustee over all things.
Eyes do not encompass Him – and all eyes are within His domain*; He is the Most Subtle, the Fully Aware. (* control / knowledge)
“Enlightening proofs came to you from your Lord; so whoever observes, it is for his own good; and whoever is blind, it is for his own harm; and I am not a guardian over you.”
And this is how We explain Our verses in different ways that they (the disbelievers) may say to you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “You have studied” – and to make it clear for the people of knowledge.
Follow what is divinely revealed to you from your Lord; there is none worthy of worship except Him; and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah willed, they would not ascribe (any partner to Him); We have not made you as a guardian over them; and you are not responsible for them.
Do not abuse those whom they worship besides Allah lest they become disrespectful towards Allah’s Majesty, through injustice and ignorance; likewise, in the eyes of every nation, We have made their deeds appear good – then towards their Lord they have to return and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swore by Allah vehemently in their oaths that if any sign came to them, they will certainly believe in it; say, “The signs are with Allah, and what do you people know that if they came to them, they will not believe.”
And We revert their hearts and their eyes – the way they had not believed the first time – and We leave them to keep wandering blindly in their rebellion.
And had We sent down the angels towards them, and had the dead spoken to them, and had We raised all things in front of them, they would still not have believed unless Allah willed – but most of them are totally ignorant.
And similarly We have appointed enemies for every Prophet – devils from men and jinns – one inspires the other with fabrications to deceive; and had your Lord willed they would not do so, therefore leave them with their fabrications.
And in order that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may lean towards it and that they may like it, and earn the sins which they are to earn.
“So shall I seek the command other than that of Allah, whereas it is He Who has sent down the detailed Book towards you?” And those whom We gave the Book know that this is the truth sent down from your Lord, so O listener, (followers of this Prophet) do not ever be of those who doubt.
And the Word of your Lord is complete in truth and justice; there is none to change His Words; He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
And O listener, (followers of the Prophet) most of the people on earth are such that were you to obey them, they would mislead you from Allah’s way; they follow only assumptions and they only make guesses.
Your Lord well knows who has strayed from His way; and He well knows the people on guidance.
So eat from that over which Allah’s name has been mentioned, if you believe in His signs.
And what is the matter with you that you should not eat from that over which Allah’s name has been mentioned whereas He has explained in detail to you all what is forbidden to you except when you are forced (by circumstances) towards it? And indeed many lead astray by their own desires, out of ignorance; indeed your Lord well knows the transgressors.
And give up the open and hidden sins; those who earn sins will soon receive the punishment of their earnings.
And do not eat that on which Allah’s name has not been mentioned, and indeed that is disobedience; and undoubtedly the devils inspire in the hearts of their friends to fight with you; and if you obey them, you are then polytheists.
And will the one who was dead and so We raised him to life and set for him a light with which he walks among the people, ever be like the one who is in realms of darkness never to emerge from them? Similarly, the deeds of disbelievers are made to appear good to them.
And similarly, We have made in every town leaders among its criminals that they may conspire in it; and they do not conspire except against themselves and they do not have perception.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, “We will not believe until we are given the same which Allah’s Noble Messengers were given”; Allah knows best where to place His message (prophethood); soon the guilty will be afflicted with disgrace before Allah and a severe punishment due to their scheming.
And whomever Allah wills to guide, He opens his bosom for Islam; and whomever He wills to send astray, He makes his bosom narrow and firmly bound as if he were being forced by someone to climb the skies; this is how Allah places the punishment on those who do not believe.
And this is the Straight Path of your Lord; We have explained in detail Our verses for the people who accept advice.
For them is the abode of peace with their Lord and He is their Master – the result of their deeds.
And the Day when He will raise them all and will proclaim, “O you group of jinns, you have enticed a lot of men”; and their human friends will submit, “Our Lord, some of us have benefited from one another and have reached the appointed term which You had set for us”; He will say, “Your home is hell – remain in it for ever, except whomever Allah wills”; O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), indeed your Lord is the Wise, the All Knowing.
And similarly We empower some of the oppressors over others – the recompense of their deeds.
“O you groups of jinns and men! Did not the Noble Messengers amongst you come to you reciting My verses and warning you of confronting this day?” They will say, “We testify against ourselves” – and the worldly life deceived them and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.
This is because your Lord does not unjustly destroy townships for their people may be unaware.
And for everyone are ranks from what they do; and your Lord is not unaware of their deeds.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), your Lord is the Perfect (Not needing anything), the Merciful; O people! If He wills, He can remove you and bring others in your stead – the way He created you from the descendants of others.
Indeed the thing which you are promised will definitely come to pass, and you cannot escape.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O my people! Keep on with your works* in your positions, I am doing mine; soon you will come to know for whom is the abode of the Hereafter; undoubtedly the unjust are never successful.” (* This is said as a challenge)
And among the crops and animals that Allah has created, they assigned (only) a portion to Him and therefore said “This is for Allah” – in their opinion – “and this is for our partners (false deities)”; so the portion for their partners does not reach Allah; and the portion for Allah reaches their partners; what an evil judgement they impose!
And similarly, their partners (the devils) have made the killing of their children seem righteous in the sight of many of the polytheists, in order to ruin them and make their religion blurred to them; and if Allah willed they would not do so, therefore leave them alone with their fabrications.
And they said, “These cattle and crops are forbidden; only those whom we wish can eat them” – in their opinion – and some cattle are those which they have forbidden riding upon, and some cattle over which they do not mention the name of Allah while slaughtering – all this is fabricating lies against Allah; He will soon repay them for their fabrications.
And they said, “The animals in the bellies of such cattle are purely for our males and forbidden to our women; and if the animal is stillborn, they all have a share of it”; soon Allah will repay them for their utterances; indeed He is Wise, All Knowing.
Indeed ruined are those who slay their children out of senseless ignorance and forbid the sustenance which Allah has bestowed upon them, in order to fabricate lies against Allah; they have undoubtedly gone astray and not attained the path.
It is He Who produces gardens spread on the ground and above, and the date-palm, and crops of various flavours, and the olive and the pomegranate, similar in some respects and unlike in others; eat from its fruit when it bears yield, and pay the due (obligatory charity) from it on the day it is harvested; and do not be wasteful; indeed the wasteful are not liked by Allah.
And from the cattle, some for burdens, some spread on the earth; eat of the sustenance which Allah has bestowed upon you, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil; undoubtedly he is your open enemy.
“Eight males and females; one pair of sheep and one of goats”; say, “Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or what the two females carry in their wombs? Answer with some knowledge, if you are truthful.”
“And a pair of camels and a pair of oxen”; say, “Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or what the two females carry in their wombs? Were you present when Allah commanded this to you?” So who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah in order to lead mankind astray with his ignorance? Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not find in what is sent down to me any eatable prohibited to a consumer, except if it is carrion, or blood flowing from blood vessels, or the flesh of swine – for that is indeed foul, or the sin causing animal over which the name of any other than Allah is taken at the time of slaughtering; so for one compelled by circumstances, neither himself desiring nor eating more than necessary, indeed your Lord is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And for the Jews We forbade all animals with claws; and forbade them the fat of oxen and sheep except which is on their backs or joined to their intestines or to the bone; We awarded this to them for their rebellion; and indeed, surely, We are truthful.
Then if they deny you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “Your Lord has boundless mercy; and His wrath is never withdrawn from the culprits.”
The polytheists will now say, “Had Allah willed, we would not have ascribed partners (to Him) nor would have our forefathers, nor would we have forbidden anything”; similarly those before them had denied, till the time they tasted Our punishment; say, “Do you have any knowledge so you can offer it to us? You follow only assumptions and only make guesses.”
Say, “Then only Allah’s argument is the complete one; so had He willed, He would have guided you all.”
Say, “Bring your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden this”; then if they do testify, O listener (followers of this Prophet) do not bear witness along with them and do not follow the desires of those who deny Our signs, and of those who do not believe in the Hereafter and who ascribed equals to their Lord.
Say, “Come – so that I may recite to you what your Lord has forbidden for you that ‘Do not ascribe any partner to Him and be good to parents; and do not kill your children because of poverty; We shall provide sustenance for all – you and them; and do not approach lewd things, the open among them or concealed; and do not unjustly kill any life which Allah has made sacred; this is the command to you, so that you may have sense.’
‘And do not approach the wealth of an orphan except in the best manner, till he reaches his adulthood; and measure and weigh in full, with justice; We do not burden any soul except within its capacity; and always speak fairly, although it may be concerning your relative; and be faithful only to Allah’s covenant; this is commanded to you, so that you may accept advice.’”
“And that, ‘This is My Straight Path, so follow it; and do not follow other ways for they will sever you from His way; this is commanded to you, so that you may attain piety.’”
Then We gave the Book to Moosa, to complete the favour on one who is virtuous, and an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, so they may believe in meeting their Lord.
And this (the Qur’an) is the blessed Book which We have sent down; so follow it and be pious, so there may be mercy upon you.
For you (the disbelievers) may say, “The Book was sent down only to two groups (Jews and Christians) before us; and we were totally unaware of what they read and taught.”
Or may say that, “If the Book had been sent down to us, we would have been more upon guidance than them”; so the clear proof and guidance and mercy has come to you, from your Lord; so who is more unjust than one who denies the signs of Allah, and turns away from them? We shall soon punish those who turn away from Our signs with a great punishment, the recompense of their turning away.
What are they waiting for – except that the angels come to them, or the punishment from your Lord, or one of the signs of your Lord? On the day when the (foretold) sign of your Lord comes, not a single soul who had not earlier accepted faith nor earned any good from its faith, will benefit from accepting faith; say, “Wait – we too are waiting.”
You (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) have no concern with those who divided their religion and became several groups; their case is only with Allah – He will then inform them of what they used to do.
For one who brings one good deed, are ten like it; and one who brings an ill-deed will not be repaid but with one like it, and they will not be wronged.
Say, “Indeed my Lord has guided me to the Straight Path; the right religion, (of) the community of Ibrahim who was free from all falsehood; and was not a polytheist.”
Say, “Undoubtedly my prayers and my sacrifices, and my living and my dying are all for Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
“He has no partner; this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first Muslim.”
Say, “Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah, whereas He is Lord of all things?” And whatever a soul earns is itself responsible for it; and no load bearing soul will bear anyone else’s load; then towards your Lord you have to return and He will inform you about the matters you differed.
And it is He who made you caliphs (viceroys) in the earth and ranked some of you high above others, in order that He may test you with what He has bestowed upon you; indeed it does not take time for your Lord to mete out punishment; and indeed, surely, He is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
