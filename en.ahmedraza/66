O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! Why do you forbid for yourself the things that Allah has made lawful for you? You wish to please some of your wives; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah has ordained expiation for your oaths; and Allah is your Master; and Allah is the All Knowing, the Wise.
And when the Holy Prophet confided a matter to one of his wives; so when she disclosed it and Allah conveyed this to the Holy Prophet, he told her part of it and held back a part; so when the Holy Prophet informed her about it, she said, “Who informed you?”; he said, “The All Knowing, the All Aware has informed me.”
If you both, the wives of the Holy Prophet, incline towards Allah, for indeed your hearts have deviated a little; and if you come together against him (the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him) then indeed Allah is his Supporter, and Jibreel and the virtuous believers are also his aides; and in addition the angels are also his aides. (Allah has created several supporters for the believers.)
It is likely that, if he divorces you, his Lord will give him wives better than you in your place -widows and maidens who are obedient, believing, respectful, penitent, serving and fasting.
O People who Believe! Save yourselves and your families from the fire, the fuel of which is men and stones – appointed over it are the extremely strict angels, who do not refuse the command of Allah and carry out whatever they are commanded.
“O disbelievers! Do not feign excuses this day; you will only be repaid what you used to do.”
O People who Believe! Incline towards Allah in a repentance that becomes a guidance for the future; it is likely that your Lord will relieve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow – on the day when Allah will not humble the Prophet and the believers along with him; their light will be running ahead of them and on their right; they will say, “Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us; indeed You are Able to do all things.”
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), wage holy war against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be strict with them; and their destination is hell; and what a wretched outcome!
Allah illustrates the example of the disbelievers – the wife of Nooh and the wife of Lut; they were bonded in marriage to two of Our bondmen deserving Our proximity – they then betrayed them so they did not benefit them the least against Allah and it was declared, “Both of you women enter the fire, along with others who enter.”
And Allah illustrates an example of the Muslims – the wife of Firaun; when she prayed, “My Lord! Build a house for me near You, in Paradise, and deliver me from Firaun and his works, and rescue me from the unjust people.”
And the example of Maryam the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity – We therefore breathed into her a Spirit from Ourselves – and she testified for the Words of her Lord and His Books, and was among the obedient.
