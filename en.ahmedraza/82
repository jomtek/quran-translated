When the heaven splits open.
And when the stars fall down.
And when the oceans are swept away.
And when the graves are overturned.
Every soul will come to know what it has sent ahead and what it left behind.
O man! What has deceived you away from your Lord, the Most Beneficent?
The One Who created you, then moulded you, then made you proper?
He moulded you into whatever shape He willed.
Not at all – but rather you deny the establishment of Justice.
And indeed there are some guardians over you.
The honourable recorders.
Knowing all what you may do.
Indeed the virtuous are in serenity.
And indeed the sinners are in hell.
They will enter it on the Day of Justice.
And will not be able to hide from it.
And what do you know – of what sort is the Day of Justice!
Again, what do you know – of what sort is the Day of Justice!
The day on which no soul will have the authority over any other soul; and on that day, the entire command belongs to Allah.
