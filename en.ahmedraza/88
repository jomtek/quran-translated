Certainly the news of the calamity that will overwhelm has come to you!
Many a face will be disgraced on that day.
Labouring, striving hard.
(Yet) Going into the blazing fire.
Made to drink water from the boiling hot spring.
There is no food for them except thorns of fire.
Which neither give strength nor satisfy the hunger.
Many a face will be in serenity on that day.
Rejoicing over their efforts.
In a high Garden.
In which they will not hear any lewd speech.
In it is a flowing spring.
In which are high thrones.
And chosen goblets.
And arranged carpets.
And linen spread out.
So do they not see the camel – how it has been created?
And the heaven – how it has been raised?
And the mountains – how they have been established?
And the earth – how it has been spread out?
Therefore advise; indeed you are a proclaimer of advice. (The Holy Prophet is a Remembrance from Allah.)
You are not at all a guardian over them.
Except whoever turns away and disbelieves –
So Allah will mete out to him the greatest punishment.
Indeed only towards Us is their return
Then indeed only upon Us is their reckoning.
