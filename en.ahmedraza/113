Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I take refuge of the One Who creates the Daybreak.”
“From the evil of His entire creation.”
“And from the evil of the matter that darkens when it sets.”
“And from the evil of the witches who blow into knots.”
“And from the evil of the envier when he is envious of me.”
