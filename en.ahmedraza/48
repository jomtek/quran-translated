We have indeed, for your sake (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), bestowed a clear victory.
So that Allah may forgive, for your sake, the sins of those before you and those after you, and complete His favours upon you, and to show you the Straight Path.
And so that Allah may provide you a great help.
It is He Who instilled peace in the hearts of the believers, so that it may increase their strength of conviction; and to Allah only belong the armies of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
In order to admit the believing men and believing women into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide, and to relieve them of their misdeeds; and this, in Allah’s sight, is the greatest success.
And to punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the polytheist men and polytheist women, who think evilly about Allah; upon them only is the evil cycle of misfortune; and Allah has wreaked anger upon them, and has cursed them, and has prepared hell for them; and what an evil destination.
And to Allah only belong the armies of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Most Honourable, Wise.
We have indeed sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as a present witness and a Herald of glad tidings and warnings. (The Holy Prophet is a witness from Allah.)
In order that you, O people, may accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and honour and revere the Noble Messenger; and may say the Purity of Allah, morning and evening. (To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)
Those who swear allegiance to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), do indeed in fact swear allegiance to Allah; Allah's Hand* of Power is above their hands; so whoever breaches his oath, has breached his own greater promise; and whoever fulfils the covenant he has with Allah – so very soon Allah will bestow upon him a great reward. (Used as a metaphor.)
The ignorant ones who had stayed behind will now say to you, “Our wealth and our families prevented us from going by keeping us pre-occupied, therefore seek forgiveness for us”; they utter with their tongues what is not in their hearts; say, “So does anyone have any control over you against Allah, if He wills to harm you or provide you benefit? In fact Allah is Aware of what you do.”
“Rather you had assumed that the Noble Messenger and the Muslims will never return to their homes, and you thought this as good within your hearts, whereas you had thought evilly; and you were a people about to be ruined.”
And whoever does not accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger – We have indeed kept prepared a blazing fire for disbelievers.
And for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; He may forgive whomever He wills, and punish whomever He wills; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who had stayed behind will now say, “When you go to receive the war booty, let us also go with you”; they wish to change the Words of Allah; say “You shall never come with us – this is already decreed by Allah”; so they will now say, “But rather you envy us”; in fact they never understood except a little.
Say to the ignorant who stayed behind, “You will soon be called against a nation of great military strength – to fight against them or that they become Muslims; so if you obey, Allah will give you an excellent reward; and if you turn away, the way you had turned away before, He will mete out a painful punishment to you.”
There is no reproach upon the blind, nor reproach against the lame, nor reproach upon the sick; and whoever obeys Allah and His Noble Messenger – Allah will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and whoever turns away – He will mete out a painful punishment to him.
Indeed Allah was truly pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you beneath the tree – so He knew what was in their hearts – He therefore sent down peace upon them, and rewarded them with an imminent victory.
And plenty of war booty, to take; and Allah is Most Honourable, Wise.
Allah has promised you plenty of booty which you will take, and has bestowed this to you quickly, and restrained peoples’ hands from you; and in order that it may be a sign for the believers, and to guide you on the Straight Path.
And one more, not within your capacity, is within Allah’s hold; and Allah is Able to do all things.
And if the disbelievers were to fight you, they will turn away and flee, and then they will not find any supporter nor any aide.
The tradition of Allah, ongoing since before; and you will not find the tradition of Allah changing.
And it is He Who restrained their hands from you, and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca, after having given you control over them; and Allah sees all what you do.
It was these who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque, and stopped the sacrificial animals from reaching their place; and were it not for some Muslim men and Muslim women, whom you do not know – lest you may crush them and unintentionally incur some violation due to them – Allah would have permitted you to slay them; this relief for them, is so that Allah may admit into His mercy whomever He wills; and had they been separated, We would have indeed punished the disbelievers among them with a painful punishment.
Whereas the disbelievers had set up in their hearts an obstinacy – the same obstinacy of the days of ignorance – so Allah sent down His solace upon His Noble Messenger and upon the believers, and decreed upon them the words of piety, and they were more deserving and suitable for it; and Allah is the All Knowing.
Allah has indeed made the truthful dream of His Noble Messenger, come true; indeed you will all enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, in safety – with your heads shaven or hair cut short – without fear; so He knows what you do not know, and has therefore ordained another imminent victory before this.
It is He Who has sent His Noble Messenger with the guidance and the true religion, in order to make it prevail over all other religions; and Allah is sufficient as a Witness. (The Holy Prophet is a light from Allah.)
Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) is the Noble Messenger of Allah; and his companions are stern with the disbelievers and merciful among themselves – you will see them bowing and falling in prostration, seeking Allah’s munificence and His pleasure; their signs are on their faces, from the effects of their prostration; this trait of theirs is mentioned in the Taurat; and their trait is mentioned in the Injeel; like a cultivation that sprouted its shoot, then strengthened it, then thickened and then stood firm upon its stem, pleasing the farmer – in order to enrage the disbelievers with them; Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those among them who have faith and do good deeds.
