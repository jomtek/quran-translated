By oath of the night when it covers
And by oath of the day when it shines
And by oath of the One Who created the male and the female.
Indeed your efforts differ.
So for one who gave and practised piety
And believed the best matter to be true
So We will very soon provide him ease.
And for him who hoarded wealth and remained carefree,
And denied the best matter,
So We will very soon provide him hardship.
His wealth will not avail him when he falls into ruin.
Indeed guiding is upon Us.
And indeed the Hereafter and this world both belong to Us.
I therefore warn you of the fire that is ablaze.
None except the most wicked will enter it.
The one who denied and turned away.
He will be far away from the most pious. (The first Caliph S. Abu Bakr Siddiq)
Who gives his wealth in order to be pure.
And no one has done a favour to him, for which he should be compensated.
He desires only to please his Lord, the Supreme.
And indeed, soon he will be very pleased.
