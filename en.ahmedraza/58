Allah has indeed heard the speech of the woman who is arguing with you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) concerning her husband, and is complaining to Allah; and Allah hears the conversation of you both; indeed Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Those among you who have proclaimed their wives as their mothers – so their wives are not their mothers; their mothers are only those that gave them birth; and undoubtedly they utter evil and a blatant lie; and indeed Allah is Most Pardoning, Oft Forgiving.
And those among you who have proclaimed their wives as their mothers and then wish to revert to the matter upon which they had uttered such an enormous word, must then free a slave before they touch one another; this is what you are advised; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
So one who cannot find a slave, must then fast for two successive months before they touch one another; and one who cannot even fast, must then feed sixty needy ones; this is in order that you keep faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger; and these are the limits of Allah; and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.
Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Noble Messenger have been humiliated, like those before them who were humiliated, and We have indeed sent down clear verses; and for the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment.
The day when Allah will raise all of them together and inform them of their misdeeds; Allah has kept count of them, whereas they have forgotten them; and all things are present before Allah.
O listener! Did you not see that Allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth? Wherever there is any discussion among three He is the fourth present with them, and among five He is the sixth, and there is no discussion among fewer or more except that He is with them wherever they may be; and then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of all what they did; indeed Allah knows all things.
Did you not see those who were forbidden from conspiracy, yet they do what was forbidden, and consult each other for sinning, and for exceeding limits, and for disobeying the Noble Messenger? And when they come in your presence, they greet you with words not chosen by Allah for respectfully greeting you, and they inwardly say, “Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?”; hell is sufficient for them; they will sink into it; and what a wretched outcome!
O People who Believe! When you consult each other, do not consult for sinning, nor for exceeding limits, nor for disobeying the Noble Messenger – and consult for righteousness and piety; and fear Allah, towards Whom you will be raised.
The evil consultation is only from the devil in order that he may upset the believers, whereas he cannot harm them in the least without Allah’s command; and only upon Allah must the Muslims rely.
O People who Believe! When you are told to give room in the assemblies, then do give room – Allah will give you room (in His mercy); and when it is said, “Stand up in reverence”, then do stand up – Allah will raise the believers among you, and those given knowledge, to high ranks; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
O People who Believe! When you wish to humbly consult with the Noble Messenger, give some charity before you consult; that is much better and much purer for you; so if you do not have the means, then (know that) Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Were you afraid to offer charity before you consult? So when you did not do this, and Allah has inclined towards you with His mercy, keep the prayers established and pay the obligatory charity and obey Allah and His Noble Messenger; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
Did you not see those who befriended those upon whom is Allah’s wrath? They are neither of you nor of these – and they swear a false oath, whereas they know.
Allah has kept prepared a severe punishment for them; indeed they commit extremely evil deeds.
They use their oaths as a shield therefore preventing from Allah’s way – so for them is a disgraceful punishment.
Their wealth and their children will be of no use to them before Allah; they are the people of hell; they are to remain in it forever.
The day when Allah will raise them all, they will swear in His presence the way they now swear in front of you, and they will assume that they have achieved something; pay heed! Indeed it is they who are the liars.
The devil has overpowered them, so they forgot the remembrance of Allah; they are the devil’s group; pay heed! Indeed it is the devil’s group who are the losers.
Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Noble Messenger, are among the most despicable.
Allah has already decreed that, “I will indeed be victorious, and My Noble Messengers”; indeed Allah is Almighty, the Most Honourable.
You will not find the people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, befriending those who oppose Allah and His Noble Messenger, even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their tribesmen; it is these upon whose hearts Allah has ingrained faith, and has aided them with a Spirit from Himself; and He will admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them forever; Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him; this is Allah’s group; pay heed! Indeed it is Allah’s group who are the successful.
