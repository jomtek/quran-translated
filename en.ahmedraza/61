All whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
O People who Believe! Why do you preach what you do not practice?
How despicable it is in the sight of Allah that you may preach what you do not practice.
Indeed Allah likes those who fight in His cause, positioned in rows, as if they were an edifice fortified.
And remember when Moosa said to his people, “O my people! Why do you trouble me, whereas you know that I am Allah’s Noble Messenger towards you?” So when they deviated, Allah deviated their hearts; and Allah does not guide the sinning people.
And remember when Eisa the son of Maryam said, “O Descendants of Israel! Indeed I am Allah’s Noble Messenger towards you, confirming the Book Torah which was before me, and heralding glad tidings of the Noble Messenger who will come after me – his name is Ahmed (the Praised One)”; so when Ahmed came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is an obvious magic.”
And who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah whereas he is being called towards Islam? And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
They wish to put out Allah’s light with their mouths, whereas Allah will perfect His light even if the disbelievers get annoyed.
It is He Who has sent His Noble Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, in order that He may make it prevail over all other religions, even if the polytheists get annoyed.
O People who Believe! Shall I show you a trade that can save you from the painful punishment?
Have faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and fight in Allah’s cause with your wealth and your lives; this is better for you, if you understand.
He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and superb dwellings in everlasting Gardens of Eden; this is the greatest success.
And He will give you another favour, which is dear to you – the help from Allah and an imminent victory; and O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), give glad tidings to the Muslims.
O People who Believe! Become the aides of Allah’s religion, the way Eisa the son of Maryam had said to the disciples, “Who will help me, inclining towards Allah?” The disciples said, “We are the aides of Allah’s religion” – so a group among the Descendants of Israel accepted faith and another group disbelieved; We therefore aided the believers against their enemies, so they were victorious.
