Proclaim the Purity of your Lord, the Supreme.
The One Who created, and then made proper.
And the One Who kept proper measure and then guided.
The One Who produced pasture.
Then made it dry and dark.
We shall now make you read (O dear Prophet Mohammed â€“ peace and blessings be upon him), so you will not forget.
Except what Allah wills; indeed He knows all the evident and all the concealed.
And We shall create the means of ease for you.
Therefore advise, if advising is beneficial.
Soon whoever fears will heed advice.
And the most wicked will stay away from it.
The one who will enter the biggest fire.
Then he neither dies in it, nor lives.
Indeed successful is the one who became pure.
And who mentioned the name of his Lord, then offered prayer.
But rather you prefer the life of this world!
Whereas the Hereafter is better and everlasting.
Indeed this is in the former scriptures.
In the Books of Ibrahim and Moosa.
