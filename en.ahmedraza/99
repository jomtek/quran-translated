When the earth is shaken with its appointed tremor.
And the earth throws out its burdens.
And man says, “What has happened to it?”
On that day earth will narrate its news,
Because your Lord sent a command to it.
On that day men will return towards their Lord, in different groups, in order to be shown their deeds.
So whoever does a good deed equal to the weight of the minutest particle, will see it.
And whoever does an evil deed equal to the weight of the minutest particle, will see it.
