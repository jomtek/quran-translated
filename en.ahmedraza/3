Alif-Laam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
Allah – none is worthy of worship, except Him, He is Alive (eternally, on His own) and the Upholder (keeps others established).
He has sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) this true Book (the Holy Qur’an), confirming the Books before it, and He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Bible). –
Before this, a guidance to mankind; and sent down the Judgement (Criterion to judge between right and wrong); indeed for those who disbelieved in the verses of Allah, is a severe punishment; and Allah is the Almighty, the Avenger (of the wrong).
Indeed nothing is hidden from Allah, neither in the earth nor in the heavens.
It is He Who fashions (moulds) you in your mothers’ wombs as He wills; none is worthy of worship except Him, the Almighty (the Most Honourable), the Wise.
It is He Who has sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) this Book (the Qur’an) containing the verses that have a clear meaning – they are the core of the Book – and other verses the meanings of which are indistinct; those in whose hearts is deviation pursue the verses having indistinct meanings, in order to cause turmoil and seeking its (wrongful) interpretation; and only Allah knows its proper interpretation; and those having sound knowledge say, “We believe in it, all of it is from our Lord”; and none accept guidance except the men of understanding.
“Our Lord! Do not deviate our hearts after You have guided us, and bestow mercy on us from Yourself; indeed You only are the Great Bestower.”
“Our Lord! Indeed You will gather all mankind for a Day about which there is no doubt"; indeed Allah’s promise does not change.
Indeed for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their offspring will help to save them in the least from Allah; and it is they who are fuel for the fire.
Like the way of Firaun’s people, and those before them; they denied Our signs; so Allah seized them because of their sins; and Allah’s punishment is severe.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) to the disbelievers, “Very soon you shall be overcome and driven towards hell; and that is a wretched resting-place.”
Indeed there was a sign for you in the two groups that clashed; one army fighting in Allah's cause, against the other of disbelievers, whom they (the Muslims) saw with their eyes, as twice their own number; and Allah strengthens with His help whomever He wills; indeed in this is a lesson for the intelligent, to be learnt by observing.
Beautified is for mankind the love of these desires – women, and sons, and heaps of gold and piled up silver, and branded horses, and cattle and fields; this is the wealth of the life of this world; and it is Allah, with Whom is the excellent abode.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Shall I inform you of something better than that? For the pious, with their Lord, are Gardens beneath which rivers flow – they will abide in it forever – and pure wives, and Allah’s pleasure”; and Allah sees the bondmen.
Those who say, “Our Lord! we have accepted faith, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of fire.”
The steadfast, and the truthful, and the reverent, and who spend in Allah's cause, and who seek forgiveness in the last hours of the night (before dawn).
Allah has given witness that there is none worthy of worship (God) except Him – and the angels and the scholars also give witness, established with justice (with truth) – there is no God except Him, the Almighty, the Wise.
Indeed the only true religion in the sight of Allah is Islam; those who had received the Books differed only after the knowledge came to them, due to their hearts’ envy; and whoever disbelieves in the signs of Allah, then Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
Then if they argue with you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “I have submitted my face (self) to Allah and likewise have my followers”; and say to the People given the Book(s) and the illiterate, “Have you submitted (accepted Islam)?” If they submit, they have attained the right path – and if they turn away (reject), then your duty is only to convey this command; and Allah is seeing the bondmen.
Those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah, and wrongfully martyr the Prophets, and slay people who enjoin justice – so give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
They are those whose deeds are wasted in this world and in the Hereafter; and they do not have any aides.
Did you not see them who have received a part of the Book – when called towards the Book of Allah for judging between them, a group of them opposes it and turns away?
They dared to do this because they say, “The fire will definitely not touch us except for a certain number of days”; and they are deceived in their religion by the lies they fabricated.
So what will be (their state) when We bring all of them together for the Day (of Resurrection) about which there is no doubt; and every soul will be paid back in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Invoke (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O Allah! Owner Of The Kingdom – You bestow the kingdom on whomever You will, and You take back the kingdom from whomever You will; and You give honour to whomever You will, and You humiliate whomever You will; only in Your Hand (control) lies all goodness; indeed, You are Able to do all things.”
“You cause part of the night to pass into the day, and You cause part of the day to pass into the night; and You bring forth the living from the dead, and You bring forth the dead from the living; and You give to whomever You will, without account.”
The Muslims must not befriend the disbelievers, in preference over the Muslims; whoever does that has no connection whatsoever with Allah, except if you fear them; Allah warns you of His wrath; and towards Allah only is the return.
Say, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Whether you hide or reveal whatever is in your hearts, Allah knows it all; and He knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and Allah has control over all things.”
On the Day when every soul will be confronted with all the good that it has done; and all the evil that it has done – it will wish that perhaps there would have been a great distance between itself and the punishment; and Allah warns you of His punishment; and Allah is Most Compassionate towards His bondmen.
Proclaim, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O mankind! If you love Allah, follow me – Allah will love you and forgive you your sins”; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Proclaim, “Obey Allah and the Noble Messenger”; so if they turn away – then Allah is not pleased with the disbelievers.
Indeed Allah chose Adam, and Nooh, and the Family of Ibrahim, and the Family of Imran over the creation.
They are the descendants one of another; and Allah is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
(Remember) When the wife of Imran said, “My Lord! I pledge to you what is in my womb – that it shall be dedicated purely in Your service, so accept it from me; indeed You only are the All Hearing, the All Knowing.”
So when she gave birth to it, she said, “My Lord! I have indeed given birth to a girl!” And Allah well knows what she gave birth to; and the boy she had prayed for is not like this girl; “And I have named her Maryam and I give her and her offspring in Your protection, against Satan the outcast.”
So her Lord fully accepted her (Maryam), and gave her an excellent development; and gave her in Zakaria’s guardianship; whenever Zakaria visited her at her place of prayer, he found new food with her; he said, “O Maryam! From where did this come to you?” She answered, “It is from Allah; indeed Allah gives to whomever He wills, without limit account.” (Miracles occur through the friends of Allah.)
It is here that Zakaria prayed to his Lord; he said, “My Lord! Give me from Yourself a righteous child; indeed You only are the Listener Of Prayer.”
And the angels called out to him while he was standing, offering prayer at his place of worship, “Indeed Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya (John), who will confirm a Word (or sign) from Allah, – a leader, always refraining from women, a Prophet from one of Our devoted ones.”
He said, “My Lord! How can I have a son when old age has reached me and my wife is barren?” He said, “This is how Allah brings about, whatever He wills.”
He said, “My Lord! Determine a sign for me”; He said, “The sign is that you shall not be able to speak to mankind for three days except by signs; and remember your Lord profusely, and proclaim His Purity before sunset and at dawn.”
And when the angels said, “O Maryam! Indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you, and has this day, chosen you among all the women of the world.”
“O Maryam! Stand in reverence before your Lord, prostrate yourself and bow along with those who bow.”
These are tidings of the hidden, which We secretly reveal to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); and you were not present with them when they threw their pens to draw lots, to know who should be the guardian of Maryam; nor were you present with them when they were quarrelling. (Yet you know of these things – this is a proof of your being a Prophet.)
And remember when the angels said, “O Maryam! Allah gives you glad tidings of a Word from Him, whose name is the Messiah, Eisa the son of Maryam – he will be honourable in this world and in the Hereafter, and among the close ones (to Allah).”
“He will speak to people while he is in the cradle and in his adulthood, and will be of the devoted ones.”
She said, “My Lord! How can I bear a child when no man has ever touched me?” He said, “This is how Allah creates whatever He wills; when He wills a thing, He only says to it, ‘Be’ – and it happens immediately.”
“And Allah will teach him the Book and wisdom, and the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Bible).”
“And he will be a Noble Messenger towards the Descendants of Israel saying, ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, for I mould a birdlike sculpture from clay for you, and I blow into it and it instantly becomes a (living) bird, by Allah’s command; and I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I revive the dead, by Allah’s command; and I tell you what you eat and what you store in your houses; undoubtedly in these (miracles) is a great sign for you, if you are believers.’ (Several miracles bestowed to Prophet Eisa are mentioned here.)
‘And I come confirming the Taurat (Torah) – the Book before me – and to make lawful for you some of the things which were forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord – therefore fear Allah and obey me.’
‘Undoubtedly Allah is the Lord of all – mine and yours – so worship Him only; this is the Straight Path.’”
So when Eisa sensed their disbelief he said, “Who will be my aides towards (in the cause of) Allah?” The disciples said, “We are the aides of Allah’s religion; we believe in Allah, and you bear witness that we are Muslims.”
“Our Lord! We have believed in what You have sent down and we follow the Noble Messenger, therefore record us among the witnesses of the truth.”
And the disbelievers conspired (to kill Eisa), and Allah covertly planned to destroy them; and Allah is the best of secret planners.
Remember when Allah said, “O Eisa! I will keep you alive till your full age, and raise you towards Me, and cleanse you of the disbelievers and give your followers dominance over the disbelievers until the Day of Resurrection; then you will all return to Me, so I shall judge between you concerning the matter in which you dispute.”
“So I shall mete a severe punishment to those who disbelieve, in this world and in the Hereafter; and they will not have any supporters.”
“And for those who believed and did good deeds, Allah will give them their full reward; and Allah does not like the unjust.”
These are some verses that We recite to you, and advice full of wisdom.
The example of Eisa with Allah is like that of Adam; He created him (Adam) from clay and then said to him, “Be” – and it thereupon happens!
O listener! (followers of this Prophet) This is the Truth from your Lord, so never be of those who doubt.
Therefore say to those who dispute with you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) concerning Eisa after the knowledge has come to you, “Come! Let us summon our sons and your sons, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves – then pray humbly, thereby casting the curse of Allah upon the liars!” (The Christians did not accept this challenge.)
This undoubtedly is the true narrative; there is none worthy of worship except Allah; and Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
So if they turn away, then indeed Allah knows those who cause turmoil.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O People given the Book(s)! Come towards a word which is common between us and you, that we shall worship no one except Allah, and that we shall not ascribe any partner to Him, and that none of us shall take one another as lords besides Allah”; then if they do not accept say, “Be witness that (only) we are Muslims.”
O People given the Book(s)! Why do you argue about Ibrahim, whereas the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Bible) were not sent down until after him? So do you not have sense?
Listen! This was what you argued about – of which you have some knowledge – why do you then argue about the matter you do not have any knowledge of? And Allah knows whereas you do not know.
Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian; but he was a Muslim, free from all falsehood; and was not of the polytheists.
Undoubtedly among all mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and the believers; and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
A group among the People given the Book(s) desire that if only they could lead you astray; and they only make themselves astray, and they do not have sense.
O People given the Book(s)! Why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, whereas you yourselves are witnesses?
O People given the Book(s)! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth, whereas you know?
And a group among the People given the Book(s) said, “Believe in what has been sent down to the believers in the morning and deny it by evening – perhaps they (the Muslims) may turn back (disbelieve).”
“And do not believe in anyone except him who follows your religion”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Only Allah’s guidance is the true guidance” – (so why not believe in it) if someone has been given similar to what was given to you, or if someone may be able to evidence it against you before your Lord; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Undoubtedly the munificence lies only in Allah’s Hand (control); He may bestow upon whomever He wills; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.”
“He chooses by His mercy, whomever He wills; and Allah is the Owner of Great Munificence.”
Among the People given the Book(s) is one who, if you trust him with a heap of treasure, will return it to you; and among them is one who, if you trust him with (just) one coin, will not return it to you unless you constantly stand over him (keep demanding); that is because they say, “We are not obliged in any way, in the case of illiterates”; and they purposely fabricate lies against Allah.
Yes, why not? Whoever fulfilled his pledge and practised piety – and indeed Allah loves the pious.
Those who accept abject prices in exchange of Allah’s covenant and their oaths, do not have a portion in the Hereafter – Allah will neither speak to them nor look towards them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and for them is a painful punishment.
And amongst them are some who distort (change words of) the Book with their tongues, so that you may think that this also is in the Book whereas it is not in the Book; and they say, “This is from Allah” whereas it is not from Allah; and they fabricate lies against Allah, whereas they know.
It is not for any human to whom Allah has given the Book and wisdom and Prophethood, that he should afterwards say to the people, “Leave (the worship of) Allah and be my worshippers” – but he will surely say, “Be sincere worshippers of Allah, because you teach the Book and you preach from it.”
And nor will he command you to appoint the angels and the Prophets as Gods; would he (a Prophet) command you to disbelieve after you have become Muslims?
And remember when Allah took a covenant from the Prophets; “If I give you the Book and knowledge and the (promised) Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) comes to you, confirming the Books you possess, you shall positively, definitely believe in him and you shall positively, definitely help him”; He said, “Do you agree, and accept My binding responsibility in this matter?” They all answered, “We agree”; He said, “Then bear witness amongst yourselves, and I Myself am a witness with you.”
So those who turn away after this – it is they who are the sinners.
So do they desire a religion other than the religion of Allah, whereas to Him has submitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or grudgingly, and it is to Him they will return?
Say, “We believe in Allah and what is sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim, and Ismael, and Ishaq, and Yaqub (Jacob) and their sons, and that which came to Moosa and Eisa and the Prophets, from their Lord; we do not make any distinction, in belief, between any of them, and to Him we have submitted ourselves.”
And if one seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him; and he is among the losers in the Hereafter.
Why should Allah will guidance for the people who disbelieved, after their having accepted faith and bearing witness that the Noble Messenger is a true one, and after clear signs had come to them? And Allah does not guide the unjust.
The recompense of such is that on them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of men combined.
Remaining in it forever; their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they get any respite.
Except those who repented thereafter and reformed themselves; then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Indeed those who disbelieve after having accepted faith, and advance further in their disbelief – their repentance will never be accepted; and it is they who are the astray.
Those who disbelieved and died as disbelievers – an earth full of gold will never be accepted from any one of them, even if he offers it, for his freedom; for them is a painful punishment and they do not have any aides.
You can never attain virtue until you spend in Allah's cause the things you love; and Allah is Aware of whatever you spend.
All food was lawful for the Descendants of Israel (Jacob), except what Israel forbade for himself, before the Taurat (Torah) was sent down; say, “Bring the Taurat and read it, if you are truthful.”
So henceforth whoever fabricates lies against Allah – it is they who are the unjust.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Allah is truthful; so follow the religion of Ibrahim, who was free from all falsehood; and he was not of the polytheists.”
Indeed the first house that was appointed as a place of worship for mankind, is the one at Mecca (the Holy Ka’aba), blessed and a guidance to the whole world;
In it are clear signs – the place where Ibrahim stood (is one of them); and whoever enters it shall be safe; and performing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of this house, for the sake of Allah, is a duty upon mankind, for those who can reach it; and whoever disbelieves – then Allah is Independent (Unwanting) of the entire creation!
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O People given the Book(s)! Why do you not believe in the verses (or signs) of Allah, whereas your deeds are being witnessed by Allah?”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O People given the Book(s)! Why do you prevent those who have accepted faith from the way of Allah, seeking to cause deviation in it, whereas you yourselves are witnesses to it? And Allah is not unaware of your deeds!”
O People who Believe! If you obey some of People given the Book(s), they will definitely turn you into disbelievers after your having accepted faith.
And how can you disbelieve, whereas Allah’s verses are recited to you and His Noble Messenger is present amongst you?! And whoever takes the support of Allah is indeed guided to the right path.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah in the manner He should rightfully be feared, and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to the rope of Allah, all of you together, and do not be divided; and remember Allah’s favour on you, that when there was enmity between you, He created affection between your hearts, so due to His grace you became like brothers to each other; and you were on the edge of a pit of fire (hell), so He saved you from it; this is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may be guided.
And there should be a group among you that invites to goodness, and enjoins good deeds and forbids immorality; it is they who are the successful.
And do not be like those who became divided and disputed after the clear signs had come to them; and for them is a terrible punishment.
On the Day (of Resurrection) when some faces will be shining and some faces black; so, (to) those whose faces are blackened, “What! You disbelieved after you had accepted faith! Therefore now taste the punishment, the result of your disbelief.”
And those whose faces will be shining, are in the mercy of Allah; they will abide in it forever.
These are the verses of Allah, which We recite to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), with truth; and Allah does not wish any injustice to the creation.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and towards Allah only is the return of all matters.
You are the best among all the nations that were raised among mankind – you enjoin good deeds and forbid immorality and you believe in Allah; and if the People given the Book(s) believed it would be better for them; some of them are believers (Muslims) and most of them are disbelievers. (The best Ummah is that of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him.)
They cannot harm you except cause some trouble; and if they fight against you, they will turn their backs on you; then they will not be helped.
Disgrace has been destined for them – wherever they are they shall not find peace, except by a rope from Allah and a rope from men – and they have deserved the wrath of Allah, and misery is destined for them; that is because they used to disbelieve in the signs of Allah, and unjustly martyr the Prophets; that was for their disobedience and transgression.
All of them are not alike; among the People given the Book(s) are some who are firm on the truth – they recite the verses of Allah in the night hours and prostrate (before Him).
They accept faith in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin good deeds and forbid immorality, and hasten to perform good deeds; and they are the righteous.
And they will not be denied the reward of whatever good they do; and Allah knows the pious.
Indeed those who disbelieve – neither their wealth nor their offspring will help save them in the least, from Allah; and they are the people of fire; remaining in it forever.
The example of what they spend in this worldly life is similar to the freezing cold wind which struck the fields of a nation who wronged themselves, and destroyed it completely; and Allah did not oppress them, but it is they who wronged themselves.
O People who Believe! Do not share your secrets with others – they do all they can to ruin you; they desire the maximum harm for you; enmity has been revealed from their speech, and what they hide in their breasts is greater; we have explained the signs clearly to you, if you have intelligence.
Listen! It is you who love them and they do not love you, whereas the fact is that you believe in all the Books; when they meet you they say, “We believe”; and when they are alone they chew their fingers at you with rage; say, “Die in your frenzy!” Allah knows well what lies within the hearts.
If some good reaches you, they feel unhappy; and if misfortune befalls you, they will rejoice; and if you remain steadfast and pious, their evil scheme will not harm you in the least; undoubtedly all what they do is encompassed by Allah.
And remember O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) when you came forth from your house in the morning, appointing the believers on positions of battle; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
When two groups among you almost decided to show cowardice – and Allah is their Protector; and in Allah only should the believers trust.
Allah indeed aided you at Badr when you had no means; so fear Allah – so that you may be thankful.
When you O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) said to the believers, “Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord may support you by sending down three thousand angels?”
Yes, why not? If you patiently endure and remain pious, and the disbelievers attack you suddenly, your Lord will send down five thousand marked angels to help you.
And Allah did not bestow this victory except for your happiness, and only that your hearts may attain peace with it; and there is no help except from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise.
So He may cut off a part of the disbelievers, or disgrace them so that they return unsuccessful.
This matter is not for you to decide – whether He guides them to repent or punishes them, for they are the unjust.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; He may forgive whomever He wills, and punish whomever He wills; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Do not devour usury doubling and quadrupling it; and fear Allah, hoping that you achieve success.
And save yourselves from the fire which is prepared for disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Noble Messenger, hoping that you gain mercy. (Obeying the Prophet is in fact obeying Allah.)
And rush towards forgiveness from your Lord, and towards a Paradise that can hold all the heavens and the earth in its width – prepared for the pious.
Those who spend in Allah’s cause, in happiness and in grief, and who control their anger and are forgiving towards mankind; and the righteous are the beloved of Allah.
And those who, when they commit an immoral act or wrong themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness of their sins – and who forgives sins except Allah? And those who do not purposely become stubborn regarding what they did.
For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it forever; what an excellent reward for the performers (of good deeds)!
Some traditions have been tried before you – therefore travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell those who denied.
This is an explanation for mankind, a guidance and an advice to the pious.
And do not be negligent nor grieve – it is you who will be victorious if you are believers.
If you have been struck by some misfortune, so they (the disbelievers) too have been struck earlier with the same misfortune; these are the days in which We have allotted turns to people; and so that Allah may make known the believers and may bestow martyrdom to some of you; and Allah does not befriend the unjust.
And so that Allah may purify* the believers, and destroy the disbelievers. (* Forgive them their sins, if any.)
What! You assume that you will enter Paradise while Allah has not yet tested your warriors, nor yet tested the steadfast?
And you used to wish for death before you met it; so now you see it before your eyes.
And Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) is purely* a Noble Messenger; there have been Noble Messengers before him; so if he departs or is martyred, will you turn back on your heels? So whoever turns back on his heels does not cause any harm to Allah; and Allah will soon reward the thankful. (* Neither God nor an angel, but a human being with the highest spiritual status.)
And no soul can die except by Allah’s command – a time has been appointed for each; whoever desires the rewards of this world, We bestow upon him from it; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We bestow upon him from it; and We shall soon reward the thankful.
And many Prophets have fought in Allah’s cause – and many devoted men were with them; so neither did they lose heart due to the calamities that befell them in Allah's cause, nor did they weaken and nor were they subdued; and the steadfast are the beloved of Allah.
And they never said anything except that they invoked, “Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and the excesses committed during our efforts, and keep our feet steady, and bestow us help over the disbelievers.”
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the best of rewards in the Hereafter; and Allah loves the righteous.
O People who Believe! If you obey the disbelievers, they will make you turn back on your heels, so you will then turn back as losers.
In fact, Allah is your Master; and He is the Best Supporter.
Soon We shall cast awe in the hearts of disbelievers because they have appointed partners to Allah, for which He has not sent any proof; their destination is hell; and what a wretched abode for the unjust!
And indeed Allah has proved true His promise to you, when you used to slay the disbelievers by His command; until the time you people lost courage and disputed about the order and disobeyed after Allah had shown you what pleases you; some of you desired the world, and some of you desired the Hereafter; thereafter He turned you away from them in order to test you; and undoubtedly He has forgiven you; and Allah is Most Munificent towards the Muslims.
When you were leaving, unconcerned without turning to look back at anyone, and from another group Our Noble Messenger was calling you (to fight); so He gave you sorrow in lieu of sorrow, and then forgave you so that you do not grieve over what has been lost or over the calamity that befell you; and Allah is Well Aware of what you do.
Then after grief, He sent down a peaceful slumber (calm), which engulfed a group among you – and another party kept fearing for their own lives, thinking wrongfully of Allah – like the thoughts of ignorance; they say, “Do we have any authority in this matter?” Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “All authority lies only with Allah”; they hide in their hearts what they do not reveal to you; they say, “Had we any control, we would not have been slain here”; say, “Even if you had been in your houses, those destined to be slain would have come forth to their places of slaying; and in order that Allah may test what is in your breasts and reveal whatever is in your hearts”; and Allah knows well what lies within the hearts.
Indeed those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met – for it was the devil who caused them to waver, because of some of their deeds; and undoubtedly Allah has forgiven them; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
O People who Believe! Do not be like the disbelievers who said regarding their brothers who went on a journey or on holy war, “If they had been here with us they would not have died or been killed” – so that Allah may make it as despair in their hearts; and Allah gives life and causes death; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
And if you are killed in Allah’s way or die, then the pardon from Allah and mercy are better than all what they hoard.
And whether you are killed or you die, towards Allah you will be gathered.
So what a great mercy it is from Allah that you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), are lenient towards them; and if you had been stern and hardhearted (unsympathetic) they would have certainly been uneasy in your company; so forgive them and intercede for them and consult with them in the conduct of affairs; and when you decide upon something, rely upon Allah; indeed Allah loves those who trust (Him).
If Allah supports you, no one can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there who can then help you? And in Allah only should the Muslims trust.
And it is unimaginable that any Prophet would hide something; and whoever hides it, will bring what he hid with him on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul will be paid in full for whatever they earned; and they will not be wronged.
So is one who follows the will of Allah equal to one who has incurred the wrath from Allah and whose home is the fire? And what a wretched place to return!
They are in different ranks before Allah; and Allah sees their deeds.
Allah has indeed bestowed a great favour upon the Muslims, in that He sent to them a Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) from among them, who recites to them His verses, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom; and before it, they were definitely in open error. (The Holy Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is one of Allah’s greatest favours to mankind.)
So will you say when disaster strikes you, though you had struck them with twice as much, “Where has this come from?” Say (to them, O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “It has come from yourselves”; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
And the calamity that struck you on the day the two armies met, was by Allah’s command – and in order that He may make known the believers.
And in order to expose them who turned hypocrites; and it was said to them, “Come, fight in Allah's cause, or repel the enemy”; they answered, “If we knew how to fight, we would certainly have been with you”; and on that day they were nearer to open disbelief than to professed faith; they utter with their mouths what is not in their hearts; and Allah knows well what they hide. –
Those who spoke regarding their brothers while they themselves stayed back at home, “Had they listened to us, they would not have been slain”; say (to them, O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Then avert your own death, if you are truthful!”
And do not ever assume that those who are slain in Allah's cause, are dead; in fact they are alive with their Lord, receiving sustenance. (Death does not mean extinction, it is the passing of the soul from this world to another. In case of virtuous believers, their bodies do not rot after death and they remain “alive”, in the manner Allah has ordained for them.)
Happy over what Allah has bestowed upon them from His grace, and rejoicing for those who will succeed them, and have not yet joined them; for on them is no fear nor any grief.
They rejoice because of the favours from Allah and (His) munificence, and because Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to the call of Allah and His Noble Messenger after they had been grieved; for the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, “The people have gathered against you, therefore fear them”, so their faith was further increased; and they said, “Allah is Sufficient for us – and what an excellent (reliable) Trustee (of affairs) is He!”
So they returned with the favour and munificence from Allah, in that no harm reached them; they followed what pleased Allah; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
It is the devil who threatens with his friends; so do not fear them and fear Me, if you have faith.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) do not grieve for those who rush towards disbelief; they cannot cause any harm to Allah; and Allah does not will to assign them any portion in the Hereafter; and for them is a terrible punishment.
Those who have purchased disbelief in exchange of faith cannot cause any harm to Allah; and for them is a painful punishment.
And never must the disbelievers be under the illusion that the respite We give them is any good for them; We give them respite only for them to further advance in their sins; and for them is a disgraceful punishment.
Allah will not leave you, O People who Believe (the Muslims) in your present state, till He separates the evil from the good; and it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to give you, the common men, knowledge of the hidden, but Allah does chose from His Noble Messengers whomever He wills; so believe in Allah and His Noble Messengers; and if you believe and practice piety, for you is a great reward. (Allah gave the knowledge of the hidden to the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
And never must those who act miserly upon what Allah has bestowed upon them of His grace, think that it is good for them; in fact it is harmful for them; soon what they had withheld will be collars round their necks on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah only is the Inheritor (Owner) of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Well Aware of what you do.
Undoubtedly Allah heard them who said, “Allah is needy, and we are the wealthy”; We shall keep recorded their saying and their wrongfully martyring of the Prophets; and We shall say, “Taste the punishment of the fire!”
“This is the recompense of what your hands have sent ahead and Allah does not oppress the bondmen.”
Those who say, “Allah has agreed with us that we should not believe in any Noble Messenger until he comes with the command to offer a sacrifice, which a fire (from heaven) shall devour”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Many Noble Messengers did come to you before me, with clear signs and with this command which you state – why did you then martyr them, if you are truthful?”
So O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) if they are denying you, Noble Messengers who came before you had also been denied, who had come with clear signs and Scriptures and the clear Book.
Every soul must taste death; and only on the Day of Resurrection will you be fully recompensed; so the one who is saved from the fire and is admitted into Paradise – he is undoubtedly successful; and the life of this world is just counterfeit wealth.
You will surely be tried in respect of your property and lives, and you will surely hear much wrong from those who were given the Book before you, and from the polytheists; and if you remain steadfast and remain pious, it is then an act of great courage.
And remember when Allah took a covenant from the People given the Book(s) that, “You shall definitely preach it to the people and not hide it”; so they flung it behind their backs and gained an abject price for it; so what a wretched bargain it is!
Do not ever think of those who rejoice for their deeds and wish to be praised without doing (good deeds) – do not ever think that they are safe from the punishment; and for them is a painful punishment.
And for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Able to do all things.
Undoubtedly in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day are signs for the intelligent.
Those who remember Allah while standing, and sitting, and reclining on their sides, and ponder about the creation of the heavens and the earth; “O our Lord! You have not created this without purpose; Purity is to You, therefore save us from the punishment of fire.”
“O our Lord! You have indeed given disgrace to whomever You put in the fire (of hell); and the unjust do not have any supporters.”
“O our Lord! We have heard a proclaimer calling towards faith, (saying) ‘Believe in your Lord’ so we have accepted faith; Our Lord! Therefore forgive us our sins, and wipe out our evil deeds, and make us die among the virtuous.”
“O our Lord! And give us what You have promised us through Your Noble Messengers, and do not humiliate us on the Day of Resurrection; indeed You do not break the promise.”
So their Lord accepted their prayer, for I do not waste the efforts of any (righteous) worker, male or female; you are all one among yourselves; so those who migrated and were driven out from their homes and were harassed in My cause, and fought, and were slain – I will certainly wipe out all their sins and will certainly admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from Allah; and only with Allah is the best reward.
O listener (followers of this Prophet)! Do not ever be deceived by the disbelievers’ free movements in the cities.
It is a brief usage; their home is hell; and what an evil resting-place!
But for those who fear their Lord are Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it for ever – the hospitality from their Lord; and that which is with Allah, is the best for the righteous.
And undoubtedly there are some among the People given the Book(s), who accept faith in Allah and what is sent down to you and what was sent down to them – their hearts are submitted humbly before Allah – they do not exchange the verses of Allah for an abject price; they are those whose reward is with their Lord; indeed Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
O People who Believe! Endure and surpass your enemies in endurance, and guard the frontiers of the Islamic nation; and keep fearing Allah, hoping that you may succeed.
