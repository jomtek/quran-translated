Alif-Laam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
This is the exalted Book (the Qur’an), in which there is no place for doubt; a guidance for the pious.
Those who believe without seeing (the hidden), and keep the (obligatory) prayer established, and spend in Our cause from what We have bestowed upon them.
And who believe in this (Qur’an) which has been sent down upon you, O beloved Prophet, (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and what was sent down before you; and are certain of the Hereafter.
It is they who are on guidance from their Lord; and they are the successful.
As for those whose fate is disbelief, whether you warn them or do not warn them – it is all one for them; they will not believe. (Because their hearts are sealed – see next verse).
Allah has sealed their hearts and their ears, and on their eyes is a covering; and for them is a terrible punishment.
And among the people are some* that say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day**” whereas they are not believers! (* The hypocrites ** the Day of Resurrection)
They wish to deceive Allah and the believers; and in fact they deceive none except themselves and they do not have any understanding.
In their hearts is a disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment, because of their lies.
And when it is said to them, “Do not cause turmoil in the earth”, they say, “We are only peacemakers!”
Pay heed! It is they who are mischievous, but they do not have sense.
And when it is said to them, “Believe as the others believe”, they say, “Shall we believe as the foolish believe?” It is they who are the fools, but they do not know.
And when they meet with the believers, they say, “We believe”; and when they are alone with their devils, they say, “We are undoubtedly with you, we were just mocking!”
Allah (befitting His Majesty) mocks them, leaving them to wander blindly in their rebellion.
These are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance – so their bargain did not profit them, and they did not know how to trade.
Their example is like that of one who kindled a fire; and when it lit up all that was around it, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, unable to see anything.
Deaf, dumb and blind; and they are not to return.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, in which are darkness, thunder and lightning; they thrust their fingers in their ears due to the thunderclaps, fearing death; and Allah has the disbelievers encompassed.
It seems the lightning may snatch away their sight from them; whenever it flashes they walk in it, and when it darkens they stand still; if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord, Who has created you and those before you, in the hope of attaining piety.
The One Who has appointed the earth a base for you, and the sky a canopy – and caused water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you; and do not knowingly set up rivals to Allah!
And if you are in any doubt concerning what We have sent down upon Our distinguished bondman (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), bring forth a single surah (chapter) equal to it; and call upon all your supporters, other than Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you are unable to bring forth (one chapter) – and We declare that you can never bring one – then fear the fire (of hell), the fuel of which is men and stones; kept ready for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds; that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; when they are provided with a fruit of the Gardens, they will say, “This is the same food as what was given to us before” whereas it is in resemblance; and in the Gardens are pure spouses for them; and they shall abide in it forever.
Indeed Allah does not, for the sake of explanation, shy to illustrate an example of anything, whether it is of a gnat or something further (inferior) than it; so the believers know it is the Truth from their Lord; as for the disbelievers, they say, “What does Allah intend by such an example?” He misleads many thereby, and He guides many thereby; and with it He misleads only those who are rebellious.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it – and sever what Allah has ordered to join, and who cause turmoil (evil / religious chaos) in the earth; it is they who are the losers.
What has made you disbelieve in Allah? Whereas you were dead and He gave you life; then He will give you death, then bring you to life again, and then it is to Him you will return!
It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth; then He inclined towards the heaven, therefore fashioning it as proper seven heavens; and He knows everything.
And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels, “I am about to place My Caliph in the earth”; they said, “Will You place (as a caliph) one who will spread turmoil in it and shed blood? Whereas we glorify You with praise and proclaim Your Sanctity”; He said, “I know what you do not.”
And Allah the Supreme taught Adam all the names (of things), then presented them to the angels, saying, “Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful.”
They said, “Purity is to You! We do not have any knowledge except what You have taught us! Indeed You only are the All Knowing, the Wise.”
He said “O Adam! Inform them the names”; and when Adam had informed them their names, He said, “Did I not tell you that I know all the secrets of the heavens and the earth? And I know all what you disclose and all what you hide?”
And (remember) when We ordered the angels to prostrate before Adam, so they all prostrated, except Iblis (Satan – devil); he refused and was proud – and became a disbeliever.
And We said, “O Adam! You and your wife dwell in this Garden, and eat freely from it wherever you please – but do not approach this tree for you will become of those who transgress.”
So the devil destabilised them in it and removed them from where they were – and We said, “Go down, one of you is an enemy to the other; and for a fixed time you shall stay on earth and feed in it.”
Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain words (of revelation), therefore Allah accepted his repentance; indeed He only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful. (See Verse 7:23)
We said, “Go down from Paradise, all of you; then if some guidance comes to you from Me – so whoever follows My guidance, for such is neither fear nor any grief.”
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, are the people of fire (hell); they will remain in it forever.
O Descendants of Israel (Jacob)! Remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant towards Me, I shall fulfil My covenant towards you; and fear Me alone.
And accept faith in what I have sent down (the Qur’an), which confirms what is with you (the Torah / Bible), and do not be the first to disbelieve in it – and do not exchange My verses for an abject – and fear Me alone.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor purposely conceal the truth.
And keep the (obligatory) prayer established, and pay the charity, and bow your heads with those who bow (in prayer).
What! You enjoin righteousness upon people while you forget (to practise it) yourselves, whereas you read the Book? Do you not have sense?
And seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard except for those who prostrate before Me with sincerity.
Who know that they have to meet their Lord, and that it is to Him they are to return.
O Descendants of Israel! Remember the favour of Mine, which I bestowed upon you and gave you superiority over others of your time. (by sending the Noble Messengers to your nation)
And fear the Day (of Resurrection) when no soul will be exchanged for another, nor will any intercession be accepted for the disbelievers, nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation nor will they be helped.
(And remember) When We rescued you from Firaun’s people, for they were inflicting you with a dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your daughters; that was a tremendous trial from your Lord (or a great reward).
And when We split the sea for you thereby rescuing you, and drowned the Firaun's people in front of your eyes.
And when We made a commitment with Moosa (Moses) for forty nights – then behind him you started worshipping the calf, and you were unjust.
Then after that We pardoned you so that you may be grateful.
And when We gave Moosa the Book (Taurat / Torah) and the criterion to judge right from wrong, so that you may attain guidance.
And when Moosa said to his people, “O my people! You have wronged yourselves by taking the calf,* therefore turn in repentance to your Creator, therefore kill each other; this is better for you before your Creator”; He therefore accepted your repentance; indeed He only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful. (* as your deity for worship)
And when you said “O Moosa! We will not believe you till we clearly see Allah”; so the thunder seized you while you were watching.
Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that you may be grateful.
And We made the clouds a canopy for you and sent down Manna and Salwa (birds) on you; “Eat of the pure things We have provided you”; they did not wrong Us in the least, but indeed they wronged themselves.
And when We said, “Enter this town and eat freely from what is in it, and enter the gate whilst prostrating, and say, ‘May our sins be forgiven’ – We will forgive you your sins; and We will soon increase the reward for the righteous.”
But the unjust changed the word that had been ordered for another one, so We sent down a punishment on them from the skies, the recompense of their disobedience.
And when Moosa asked for water for his people, We said, “Strike this rock with your staff”; thereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it; each group recognised its drinking-place; “Eat and drink from what Allah has provided, and do not roam about the earth making turmoil in it.”
And when you said, “O Moosa! We shall never put up with only one kind of food, so call upon your Lord to produce for us what the earth grows – some herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils and onions”; he said, “What! You wish to exchange the better for something inferior? Therefore settle down in Egypt or any city, where you will get what you demand”; and disgrace and misery were destined for them; and they returned towards Allah’s wrath; that was because they disbelieved in Allah’s signs and wrongfully martyred the Prophets; that was for their disobedience and transgression.
Indeed the believers (the Muslims) and those among the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabeans who sincerely accept faith in Allah and the Last Day* and do good deeds – their reward is with their Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve. (* i.e. convert to Islam)
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you; “Accept and hold fast to what We give you, and remember what is in it, so that you may attain piety.”
Then after that, you turned away; and were it not for the munificence of Allah and His mercy, you would be among the losers.
And you certainly know of those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of Sabth (Sabbath – Saturday) – We therefore said to them, “Become apes, despised!”
So We made this incident (of that town) a warning to the surrounding towns (others of their time) and to succeeding generations, and a lesson for the pious.
And (remember) when Moosa said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow”; they said, “Are you making fun of us?” He answered, “Allah forbid that I should be of the ignorant!”
They said, “Pray to your Lord that He may describe the cow”; said Moosa, “He says that it is a cow neither old nor very young but between the two conditions; so do what you are commanded.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord that He may reveal its colour to us”; answered Moosa, “Indeed He says it is a yellow cow, of bright colour, pleasing to the beholders.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord that He may clearly describe the cow to us, we are really in a doubt as to which cow it is; and if Allah wills, we will attain guidance.”
Said Moosa, “He says, ‘She is a cow not made to work, neither ploughing the soil nor watering the fields; flawless and spotless’; they said, “You have now conveyed the proper fact”; so they sacrificed it, but seemed not to be sacrificing it (with sincerity).
And (remember) when you slew a man and were therefore accusing each other concerning it; and Allah wanted to expose what you were hiding.
We therefore said, “Strike the dead man with a part of the sacrificed cow”; this is how Allah will bring the dead to life, and shows you His signs so that you may understand!
Then after it, your hearts hardened – so they are like rocks, or even harder; for there are some rocks that rivers gush forth from them; and some that water flows from them when they split asunder; and there are rocks that fall down for the fear of Allah; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
So O Muslims, do you wish for the Jews to accept faith in you whereas a group of them used to listen to the Words of Allah, and then after having understood it, purposely changed it?
And when they meet the believers, they say, “We believe”; but when they are in isolation with one another they say, “You clarify to the believers from what Allah has disclosed to you, so that they may evidence it against you before your Lord? So have you no sense?”
Do they not know that Allah knows all whatever they hide and whatever they disclose?
And among them are the unlearned that do not know anything of the Book except to recite something therefrom or parts of their own fabrications; they are in absolute illusion.
Therefore woe is to those who write the Book with their hands; and they then claim, “This is from Allah” in order to gain an abject (worldly) price for it; therefore woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn with it.
And they said, “The fire will not touch us except for a certain number of days”; say, “Have you taken a covenant from Allah – then Allah will certainly not break His covenant – or do you say something concerning Allah what you do not know?”
Yes, why not?* The one who earns evil and his sin surrounds him; he is from the people of fire (hell); they will remain in it forever. (You will remain in the fire forever).
And those who believe and do good deeds – they are the People of Paradise; they will abide in it forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Descendants of Israel that, “Do not worship anyone except Allah; and be good to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to people and keep the prayer established and pay the charity”; thereafter you retracted, except some of you; and you are those who turn away.
And when We took a covenant from you that, “Do not shed the blood of your own people nor turn out your own people from your colonies”; you then acknowledged it and you are witnesses.
Then it is you who began slaying each other and you drive out a group of your people from their homeland – providing support against them (to their opponents) through sin and injustice; and if they come to you as captives you redeem them, whereas their expulsion itself is forbidden to you; so do you believe in some of Allah’s commands and disbelieve in some? So what is the reward of those who do so, except disgrace in this world? And on the Day of Resurrection they will be assigned to the most grievous punishment; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
These are the people who bought the worldly life in exchange of the Hereafter – so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moosa (Moses) the Book and subsequent to him, sent Noble Messengers one after another – and We gave Eisa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit; so when a Noble Messenger from Allah comes to you bringing what you yourselves do not desire, you grow arrogant; so you disbelieve in a group of the Prophets and another group of Prophets you slay!
And the Jews said, “Our hearts are covered”; in fact Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief, so only a few of them accept faith.
And when the Book from Allah (the Holy Qu’ran) came to them, which confirms the Book in their possession (the Taurat / Torah) – and before that they used to seek victory through the medium of this very Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) over the disbelievers; so when the one whom they fully recognised (the Holy Prophet) came to them, they turned disbelievers – therefore Allah’s curse is upon the disbelievers.
How abject is the price for which they exchange their lives that they should disbelieve in what Allah has sent down, jealous that Allah should reveal of His grace to whomever He wills of His bondmen! So they deserved wrath upon wrath; and for the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down", they say, “We believe in what was sent down to us, and disbelieve in the rest” – whereas it is the Truth confirming what they possess! Say (to them, O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Why did you then martyr the earlier Prophets, if you believed in your Book?”
And indeed Moosa came to you with clear signs, and after it you worshipped the calf – and you were unjust.
And remember when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount Tur (Sinai) above you; “Accept and hold fast to what We give you, and listen”; they said, “We hear and we disobey”; and the calf was still embedded in their hearts because of their disbelief; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What an evil command is what your faith orders you, if you are believers!”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “If the abode of the Hereafter in the sight of Allah is for you alone and none else, then long for death if you are truthful!”
And they will never long for it, because of the evil deeds they have done in the past; and Allah knows the unjust, very well.
And you will surely find them the greediest among mankind for life; and (likewise) among the polytheists (idolaters); each one of them yearns to live a thousand years; and the grant of such age will not distance him from the punishment; and Allah is seeing their misdeeds.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel (Gabriel)” – for it is he who has brought down this Qu’ran to your heart by Allah’s command, confirming the Books before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to Muslims. –
“Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His Noble Messengers, and Jibreel and Mikaeel (Michael) -, then (know that), Allah is an enemy of the disbelievers.”
We have indeed sent down to you clear signs; and none will disbelieve in them except the sinners.
And is it that whenever they make a covenant, only a group of them throws it aside? In fact, most of them do not have faith.
And when a Noble Messenger from Allah came to them, confirming the Book(s) which they possessed, a group of those who have received the Book(s) flung the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they were totally unaware!
And they followed what the devils used to read during the rule of Sulaiman (Solomon – peace and blessings be upon him); and Sulaiman did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved – they teach people magic; and that which was sent down to the two angels, Harut and Marut in Babylon; and the two (angels) never taught a thing to anyone until they used to say, “We are only a trial, therefore do not lose your faith” and they used to learn from them that by which they cause division between man and his wife; and they cannot harm anyone by it except by Allah’s command; and they learn what will harm them, not benefit them; and surely they know that whoever bargains for this will not have a share in the Hereafter; and for what an abject thing they have sold themselves; if only they knew!
And had they believed and been pious, then the recompense from Allah is extremely good; if only they knew!
O People who Believe, do not say (to the Prophet Mohammed- peace and blessings be upon him), “Raena (Be considerate towards us)” but say, “Unzurna (Look mercifully upon us)", and listen attentively from the start; and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment. (To disrespect the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is blasphemy.)
Those who disbelieve – the People given the Book(s) or the polytheists – do not wish that any good be sent down upon you from your Lord; and Allah chooses whomever He wills by His Mercy; and Allah is the Most Munificent.
When We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We will bring one better than it or one similar; do you not know that Allah is Able to do all things?
Do you not know that for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth? And except Allah, you have neither a protector nor any supporter?
Do you wish to ask your Noble Messenger a question similar to what Moosa was asked before? And whoever chooses disbelief instead of faith has gone astray from the Right Path.
Many among People given the Book(s) wished to turn you to disbelief after you had accepted faith; out of hearts’ envy, after the truth has become very clear to them; so leave them and be tolerant, until Allah brings His command; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
And keep the prayer established, and pay the charity; and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves, you will find it with Allah; indeed Allah is seeing your deeds.
And the People given the Book(s) said, “None will enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian”; these are their own imaginations; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Bring your proof, if you are truthful.”
Yes, why not? Whoever submits his face for the sake of Allah, and is virtuous, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews said, “The Christians are nothing” – and the Christians said, “The Jews are nothing” whereas they both read the Book; and the ignorant spoke similarly; so Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection, concerning the matter in which they dispute.
And who is more unjust than one who prevents the name of Allah being mentioned in the mosques, and strives for their ruin? It did not befit them to enter the mosques except in fear; for them is disgrace in this world, and a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.
And the East and the West, all belong to Allah – so whichever direction you face, there is Allah’s Entity (Allah’s Mercy is directed towards you); indeed Allah is the All Capable, (His powers and reach are limitless), the All Knowing.
And they said, “Allah has taken an offspring for Himself” – Purity is to Him! In fact, all that is in the heavens and the earth, is His dominion; all are submissive to Him.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth – and when He commands a thing, He only says to it, “Be", and it thereupon happens.
And the ignorant people said, “Why does not Allah speak to us, or some sign come to us?” Those before them had also spoken in the same way as they speak; their hearts (and of those before them) are all alike; undoubtedly, We have made the signs clear for the people who have faith.
Undoubtedly, We have sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) with the truth, giving glad tidings and conveying warning, and you will not be questioned about the people of hell.
And never will the Jews or the Christians be pleased with you, until you follow their religion; say, “The guidance of Allah only is the (true) guidance”; and were you (the followers of this Prophet) to follow their desires after the knowledge has come to you, you would then not have a protector or aide against Allah.
Those to whom We have given the Book, read it in the manner it should be read; it is they who believe in it; and those who deny it – it is they who are the losers.
O Descendants of Israel! Remember the favour of Mine which I bestowed upon you and made you superior to all others of your time. (By sending Noble Messengers among you).
And fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another, nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation, nor will any intercession benefit the disbelievers, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when Ibrahim’s (Abraham’s) Lord tested him in some matters and he fulfilled them; He said, “I am going to appoint you as a leader for mankind”; invoked Ibrahim, “And of my offspring”; He said, “My covenant does not include the unjust (wrong-doers).”
And remember when We made this House (at Mecca) a recourse for mankind and a sanctuary; and take the place where Ibrahim stood, as your place of prayer; and We imposed a duty upon Ibrahim and Ismail (Ishmael), to fully purify My house for those who go around it, and those who stay in it (for worship), and those who bow down and prostrate themselves.
And (remember) when Ibrahim prayed, “My Lord! Make this city a place of security and bestow upon its people various fruits as providence – for those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day (of Resurrection)”; He answered, “And whoever disbelieves, I shall provide him also some subsistence and then compel him towards the punishment of fire (hell); and that is a wretched place to return.”
And (remember) when Ibrahim was raising the foundations of the House, along with Ismail; (saying), “Our Lord! Accept it from us; indeed You only are the All Hearing, the All Knowing.”
“Our Lord! And make us submissive towards you and from our offspring a nation obedient to You – and show us the ways of our worship, and incline towards us with Your mercy; indeed You only are the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.”
“Our Lord! And send towards them a Noble Messenger, from amongst them, to recite to them Your verses, and to instruct them in Your Book and sound wisdom*, and to fully purify them; indeed You only are the Almighty, the Wise.” (The traditions of the Holy Prophet – sunnah and hadith – are called wisdom.)
And who will renounce the religion of Ibrahim except him who is a fool at heart? We indeed chose him (Ibrahim) in this world; and indeed in the Hereafter he is among those worthy of being closest to Us.
When his Lord said to him, “Submit”, he said, “I have submitted to the Lord Of The Creation.”
And Ibrahim willed the same religion upon his sons, and also did Yaqub (Jacob); (saying), “O my sons – indeed Allah has chosen this religion for you; therefore do not die except as Muslims (those who submit to Him).”
In fact, some of you yourselves were present when death approached Yaqub and when he said to his sons, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We shall worship Him Who is your God, and is the God of your fathers, Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq (Isaac) – the One God; and to Him we have submitted ourselves.”
This was a nation that has passed away; for them is what they earned, and yours is what you earn; and you will not be questioned about their deeds.
And the People given the Book(s) said, “Become Jews or Christians – you will attain the right path”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “No – rather we take the religion of Ibrahim, who was far removed from all falsehood; and was not of the polytheists.”
Say, “We believe in Allah and what is sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim, and Ismael, and Ishaq, and Yaqub, and to their offspring, and what was bestowed upon Moosa and Eisa (Jesus), and what was bestowed upon other Prophets – from their Lord; we do not make any distinction, in belief, between any of them; and to Allah we have submitted ourselves.”
And if they believe in the same way you have believed, they have attained guidance; and if they turn away, they are clearly being stubborn; so Allah will soon suffice you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) against them; and He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
“We have taken the colour (religion) of Allah; and whose colour (religion) is better than that of Allah? And only Him do we worship.”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What! You dispute with us concerning Allah, whereas He is our Lord and also yours? Our deeds are with us and with you are your deeds; and only to Him do we sincerely belong.”
“In fact you claim that Ibrahim, and Ismail, and Ishaq, and Yaqub, and their offspring were Jews or Christians”; say, “Do you know better, or does Allah?”; and who is more unjust than one who has the testimony from Allah and he hides it? And Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
They were a group that has passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you is what you earn; and you will not be questioned about their deeds.
So now the foolish people will say, “What has turned the Muslims away from the qiblah (prayer direction) which they formerly observed?”; proclaim, “To Allah only belong the East and the West; He guides whomever He wills upon the Straight Path.”
And so it is that We have made you the best nation* for you are witnesses** against mankind, and the Noble Messenger is your guardian and your witness; and (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) We had appointed the qiblah which you formerly observed only to see (test) who follows the Noble Messenger, and who turns away; and it was indeed hard except for those whom Allah guided; and it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to waste your faith! Indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful towards mankind. (* The best Ummah is that of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him. ** The Holy Prophet is a witness from Allah.)
We observe you turning your face, several times towards heaven (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); so We will definitely make you turn (for prayer) towards a qiblah which pleases you; therefore now turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque (in Mecca); and O Muslims, wherever you may be, turn your faces (for prayer) towards it only; and those who have received the Book surely know that this is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not unaware of their deeds. (Allah seeks to please the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
And even if you were to bring all the signs to the People given the Book(s), they would not follow your qiblah; nor should you follow their qiblah; nor do they follow each others qiblah; and were you (the followers of this Prophet) to follow their desires after having received knowledge, you would then surely be unjust.
Those to whom We gave the Book(s) recognise the Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as men (or they) recognise their own sons; and undoubtedly a group among them purposely conceals the truth.
This is the Truth from your Lord, therefore (O those who listen) beware – do not be in doubt.
And each one has a direction towards which he inclines, therefore strive to surpass others in good deeds; Allah will bring you all together, wherever you may be; indeed Allah may do as He wills.
And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and indeed it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be, O Muslims, turn your faces towards it only, so that people may not have an argument against you – except those among them who do injustice; therefore do not fear them, and fear Me; and this is in order that I complete My favour upon you and that you may attain guidance. –
The way We have sent to you a Noble Messenger from among you, who recites to you Our verses and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and sound wisdom*, and teaches you what you did not know. (The traditions / sayings of the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him).
Therefore remember Me, I will cause you to be spoken of and acknowledge My rights, and do not be ungrateful.
O People who Believe! Seek help from patience and prayer; indeed Allah is with those who patiently endure.
And do not utter regarding those who are slain in Allah's cause as “dead”; in fact they are alive, but it is you who are unaware.
And We will surely test you with some fear and hunger, and with paucity of wealth and lives and crops; and give glad tidings to those who patiently endure. –
Those who say when calamity befalls them, “Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed it is to Him we are to return.”
These are the people upon whom are the blessings from their Lord, and mercy; and it is they who are on guidance.
Undoubtedly Safa and Marwah* are among the symbols of Allah; so there is no sin on him, for whoever performs the Hajj (pilgrimage) of this House (of Allah) or the Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), to go back and forth between them; and whoever does good of his own accord, then (know that) indeed Allah is Most Appreciative (rewards virtue), the All Knowing. (These are 2 hillocks near the Holy Ka’aba)
Indeed those who hide the clear proofs and the guidance which We sent down, after We made it clear to mankind in the Book – upon them is the curse of Allah and the curse of those who curse.
Except those who repent and do reform and disclose (the truth) – so I will accept their repentance; and I only am the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.
Indeed upon those who disbelieved, and died as disbelievers, is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of men combined.
They will remain in it forever; neither will the punishment be lightened for them, nor will they be given respite.
Your God is One God; there is no God except Him – the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the continuous alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail the seas carrying what is of use to men, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky thereby reviving the dead earth and dispersing all kinds of beasts in it, and the movement of the winds, and the obedient clouds between heaven and earth – certainly in all these are signs for the intelligent.
And some people create for themselves Gods (objects of worship) other than Allah, with devotion (love) equal to the devotion of Allah; and the believers do not love anybody with love equal to the love of Allah; and what will be their state, when the punishment will be before the eyes of the unjust (disbelievers)? For all power belongs wholly to Allah, and because Allah’s punishment is very severe.
(The day) when the leaders will be disgusted with their followers – and they shall see their punishment, and all their links will be cut off.
And the followers will say, “If we were to return (to earth), we would break off from them like they have broken off from us”; this is how Allah will show them their deeds as despair for them; and they will never come out from the fire (hell).
O mankind! Eat from what is lawful and clean in the earth; and do not follow the footsteps of the devil; undoubtedly he is your open enemy.
For he will only instruct you towards the evil and the shameful, and that you fabricate matters concerning Allah, what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down”, they say, “On the contrary, we shall follow what we found our forefathers upon”; What! Even if their forefathers had no intelligence, or guidance?!
And the example of the disbelievers is similar to one who calls upon one that hears nothing except screaming and yelling; deaf, dumb, blind – so they do not have sense.
O People who Believe! Eat of the good things We have provided you, and be grateful to Allah if it is only Him you worship.
He has forbidden for you only the carrion, and blood, and flesh of swine, and the animal that has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of anyone other than Allah; so there is no sin on him who is compelled and does not eat out of desire, nor eats more than what is necessary; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who hide the Book sent down by Allah and exchange it for an abject price – they only fill their bellies with fire and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them; and for them is a painful punishment.
They are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance, and torment in exchange of pardon; so how much can they bear the fire?
This is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth; and indeed those who caused disagreement in the Book are, surely, disputants in the extreme.
Basic virtue is not just to turn faces to the East and the West, but true righteousness is that one must believe in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the Prophets; and out of love for Allah, to give treasured wealth to relatives and to the orphans and the needy and the traveller, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free; and to keep the prayer established and to pay the charity; and those who fulfil their obligations when they make an agreement; and the patient during times of calamity, in hardships and during holy war; it is they who have proved true to their word; it is they who are the pious.
O People who Believe! Retribution is made obligatory for you in the matter of those killed unjustly; a freeman for a freeman, and a slave for a slave, and a female for a female; and for him who is partly forgiven by his brother, seek compensation with courtesy and make payment in proper manner; this is a relief and a mercy upon you, from your Lord; so after this, a painful punishment is for whoever exceeds the limits.
And there is life for you in retribution, O men of understanding, so that you may avoid.
It is ordained for you that when death approaches one of you, and he leaves behind wealth, he must bequeath it to parents and near relatives in accordance with tradition; this is a duty upon the pious.
So whoever changes the will after he has heard it – its sin is only upon those who change it; indeed Allah is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Then if one fears that the will maker (the deceased) has done injustice or sin, and he makes a reconciliation between the parties, there shall be no sin upon him; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Fasting is made compulsory for you, like it was ordained for those before you, so that you may attain piety.
For a certain number of days only; so whoever is sick among you, or on a journey, the same number in other days; and those who do not have the strength for it must give a redemption by feeding a needy person; so whoever increases the good of his own accord, it is better for him; and fasting is better for you, if only you realise.
The month of Ramadan in which was sent down the Qur’an – the guidance for mankind, the direction and the clear criteria (to judge between right and wrong); so whoever among you witnesses this month, must fast for the (whole) month; and whoever is sick or on a journey, may fast the same number in other days; Allah desires ease for you and does not desire hardship for you – so that you complete the count (of fasts), and glorify Allah’s greatness for having guided you, and so that you may be grateful.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), when My bondmen question you concerning Me, then surely I am close; I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on Me, so they must obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may attain guidance.
Going to your wives during the nights of the fast is made lawful for you; they are coverings for you and you are coverings for them; Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves (in this respect), so He accepted your penance and forgave you; so cohabit with them and seek what Allah has destined for you – and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread at dawn – then complete the fast till nightfall; and do not touch women while staying in seclusion for worship in the mosques; these are the limits imposed by Allah, so do not go near them; this is how Allah explains His verses to mankind so that they may attain piety.
And do not unjustly devour the property of each other, nor take their cases to judges in order that you may wrongfully devour a portion of other peoples’ property on purpose.
They ask you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), regarding the crescents; say, “They are indicators of time for mankind and for Hajj (the pilgrimage)”; and it is not a virtue at all that you enter the houses by demolishing their back portions, but in reality virtue is piety; and enter the houses using their gates – and keep fearing Allah, hoping that you achieve success.
And fight in Allah's cause against those who fight you and do not exceed the limits; and Allah does not like the transgressors.
And slay the disbelievers wherever you find them, and drive them out from where they drove you out, and the turmoil they cause is worse than slaying; and do not fight them near the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there; so if they fight you, slay them; this is the punishment of the disbelievers.
Then if they desist, then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And fight them until no mischief remains, and only Allah is worshipped; then if they desist, do not harm them, except the unjust.
The sacred month for the sacred month, and respect in lieu of respect; harm the one who harms you, to the extent as he did – and keep fearing Allah, and know well that Allah is with the pious.
And spend your wealth in Allah's cause, and do not fall into ruin with your own hands; and be virtuous; undoubtedly the righteous are the beloved of Allah.
And perform Hajj (greater pilgrimage) and Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) for Allah; and if you are prevented, send sacrifice whatever is available; and do not shave your heads until the sacrifice reaches its destination; so whoever among you is sick or has an ailment in the head, must pay a compensation by fasting or charity or sacrifice; then when you are in peace – and whoever takes the advantage of combining the Hajj and Umrah, it is compulsory for him to sacrifice whatever is available; and whoever cannot afford it, must fast for three days while on the pilgrimage, and seven when you have returned to your homes; these are ten in all; this decree is for him who is not a resident of Mecca; and keep fearing Allah and know well that Allah’s punishment is severe.
The Hajj is during the well-known months; and for one who intends to perform the Hajj in it – neither is there to be mention of cohabitation in the presence of women, nor any sin, nor a fight with anyone till the completion of Hajj; and whatever good you do, Allah knows it; and take provision along with you for the best provision is piety; and keep fearing Me, O men of understanding!
It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord; so when you return from Arafat, remember Allah near the Sacred Symbol (Mash’ar al Haram) – and remember Him in the manner He has guided you; and indeed, before this, you were of the astray.
Then, O people of Quraish, you too must return from the place where the people return from, and ask forgiveness from Allah; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
So when you have completed your Hajj rites, remember Allah as you used to remember your forefathers, in fact more than that; and among the people are some that say, “Our Lord! Give us in this world” – and he does not have a portion in the Hereafter.
And among them are some that say, “Our Lord! Give us good in the world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the punishment of fire!”
For such is a portion from what they have earned; and Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
And remember Allah in the counted days; so whoever hastens by departing in two days, there is no sin on him; and whoever stays on, there is no sin for him – for the pious; and keep fearing Allah, and know well that it is to Him you will be raised.
And among men is one whose conversation may please you in the life of this world, and he brings Allah as witness to what is in his heart, whereas he is the biggest quarreller!
And when he turns away, he creates turmoil in the earth and destroys crops and lives; and Allah is not pleased with turmoil.
And when it is said to him, “Fear Allah”, he becomes more resolute in committing sin – therefore hell is sufficient for such; and that is indeed, a very wretched resting place.
And among men is one who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Most Compassionate towards the bondmen.
O People who Believe! Enter Islam in full – and do not follow the footsteps of the devil; indeed he is your open enemy.
And if you renege, even after the clear commands have come to you, then know well that Allah is Almighty, Wise.
What are they waiting for, except that Allah’s punishment should come through stretched clouds and the angels descend and the matter be finished? And all matters are directed only towards Allah.
Ask the Descendants of Israel how many clear signs We gave them; and whoever alters Allah’s favour which came to him, then indeed Allah’s punishment is severe.
The life of this world is made to appear beautiful in the sight of the disbelievers, and they make fun of the believers; and the pious will be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah may give to whomever He wills, without account.
Mankind was on one religion; so Allah sent Prophets giving glad tidings and warnings – and with them sent down the true Book to judge between mankind on their differences; and only those to whom it was given created disputes regarding the Book, after clear commands had come to them, due to hostility of one another; so Allah, by His command, made the truth clear to the believers, concerning their disputes; and Allah may guide whomever He wills to the Straight Path.
Are you under the illusion that you will enter Paradise whereas the suffering, which came to those before you, has not yet come to you? Hardship and adversity befell them and they were shaken, to the extent that the Noble Messenger and the believers along with him said, “When will the help of Allah come?”; pay heed! Allah’s help is surely near.
They ask you what they should spend; say, “Whatever you spend for good, is for parents and near relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveller”; and whatever good you do, indeed Allah knows it.
Fighting in Allah's cause is ordained for you, whereas it is disliked by you; and it is possible that you hate a thing which is better for you; and it is possible that you like a thing which is bad for you; and Allah knows, and you do not know.
They ask you the decree regarding fighting in the sacred month; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Fighting in it is a great sin; and to prevent from the way of Allah, and not to believe in Him and to prevent (people) from the Sacred Mosque and to expel its residents – these are greater sins before Allah"; and the turmoil they cause is worse than killing; and they will keep fighting you till they turn you away from your religion, if they can; and whoever among you turns renegade and dies as a disbeliever, then their deeds are wasted in this world and in the Hereafter; and they are the people of hell; they will remain in it forever.
Those who believed, and those who migrated for the sake of Allah, and fought in Allah's cause – they are hopeful of gaining Allah’s mercy; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
They ask you the decree regarding wine (intoxicants) and gambling; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “In both is great sin, and some worldly benefit for men – but their sin is greater than their benefit”; and they ask you what they should spend; say, “That which remains spare (surplus)”; this is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may think.
Before you execute your deeds of this world and of the Hereafter; and they ask you the decree regarding orphans; say, “To do good towards them is better; and if you combine your expenses with theirs, they are your brothers”; and Allah knows very well the one who spoils from him who improves; and if Allah willed, He could have put you in hardship; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
And do not marry polytheist women until they become Muslims; for undoubtedly a Muslim bondwoman is better than a polytheist woman, although you may like her; and do not give your women in marriage to polytheist men until they accept faith; for undoubtedly a Muslim slave is better than a polytheist, although you may like him; they invite you towards the fire; and Allah invites towards Paradise and forgiveness by His command; and explains His verses to mankind so that they may accept guidance.
And they ask you the decree concerning menstruation; say, “It is an impurity, so stay away from women at such times, and do not cohabit with them until they have cleansed themselves; so when they have cleansed themselves, cohabit with them the way Allah has determined for you”; indeed Allah loves those who repent profusely, and loves those who keep clean.
Your women are a tillage for you; so come into your tillage as you will; and first perform the deeds that benefit you; and keep fearing Allah, and know well that you have to meet Him; and (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) give glad tidings to the Muslims.
And do not make Allah a target of your oaths, by pledging against being virtuous and pious, and against making peace among mankind; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Allah does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but He does take you to task for deeds which your hearts have done; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
Those who swear not to touch their wives have four months’ time; so if they turn back during this period, indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And if they firmly decide to divorce them, Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
And divorced women shall restrain themselves for three menstrual periods; and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day; and their husbands have the right to take them back, during this time, if they desire reconciliation; and the women also have rights similar to those of men over them, in accordance with Islamic law – and men have superiority over them; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
This type of divorce is up to twice; the woman must then be retained on good terms or released with kindness; and it is not lawful for you to take back from women a part of what you have given them except when both fear that they may not be able to stay within the limits established by Allah; so if you fear that they may not be able to observe the limits of Allah, then it is no sin on them if the woman pays to get her release; these are the limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them; and those who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.
Then if he divorces her the third time, she will not be lawful to him until she has stayed with another husband; then if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin for these two to reunite if they consider that they can keep the limits of Allah established; these are the limits set by Allah which He explains for people of intellect.
And when you have divorced women, and their term reaches its end, either retain them on good terms within this period or release them with kindness; and do not retain them in order to hurt them, hence transgressing the limits; and he who does so harms only himself; and do not make the signs of Allah the objects of ridicule; and remember Allah’s favour that is bestowed upon you and that He has sent down to you the Book and wisdom, for your guidance; keep fearing Allah and know well that Allah knows everything. (The traditions of the Holy Prophet – sunnah and hadith – are called wisdom.)
And when you have divorced women and they complete their waiting period – then O guardians of such women, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands if they agree between themselves in accordance with Islamic law; this lesson is for those among People who Believe in Allah and the Last Day; this is purer for you, and cleaner; and Allah knows and you do not know.
And mothers shall breast-feed their children for two full years – for those who wish to complete the term of milk feeding; and the father of the child must provide for food and clothing of the mother in accordance with custom; no one will be burdened except with what he can bear; a mother should not be harmed because of her child, nor he to whom the child is born be harmed because of his child (or a mother should not harm the child nor he to whom the child is born should harm the child); and the same is incumbent on the guardian in place of the father; then if the parents desire to wean the child by mutual consent and consultation, it is no sin for them; and if you wish to give your children out to a (milk feeding) nurse, it is no sin for you, provided you pay to them what is agreed, with kindness; and keep fearing Allah, and know well that Allah is seeing what you do.
And those among you who die leaving wives behind them, then such widows shall restrain themselves for four months and ten days; so when their term is completed, O guardians of such women, there is no sin on you in what the women may decide for themselves in accordance with Islamic law; and Allah is Well Aware of what you do.
And there is no sin on you if you propose marriage to women while they are hidden from your view, or hide it in your hearts; Allah knows that you will now remember them, but do not make secret pacts with women except by decent words recognised by Islamic law; and do not consummate the marriage until the written command reaches its completion; know well that Allah knows what is in your hearts, therefore fear Him; and know well that Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
There is no sin upon you if you divorce women while you have not touched them or appointed their bridal money; and give them some provision; the rich according to their means, and the poor according to their means; a fair provision according to custom; this is a duty upon the virtuous.
If you divorce them before you have touched them and have appointed the bridal money, then payment of half of what is agreed is ordained unless the women forgo some of it, or he in whose hand is the marriage tie, pays more; and O men, your paying more is closer to piety; and do not forget the favours to each other; indeed Allah is seeing what you do.
Guard all your prayers, and the middle prayer; and stand with reverence before Allah.
And if you are in fear, pray while on foot or while riding, as you can; when you are in peace remember Allah the way He has taught you, which you did not know.
And those among you who die leaving wives behind them – they should bequeath for their wives a complete provision for one full year without turning them out; so if they go out themselves, there is no sin on you regarding what they do of themselves in a reasonable manner; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
And for divorced women also, is a complete provision in reasonable manner; this is a duty upon the pious.
This is how Allah explains His verses to you so that you may understand.
Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) not see those who left their homes, whereas they numbered in thousands, fearing death? So Allah said to them, “Die”; He then brought them back to life; indeed Allah is Most Munificent towards mankind, but most men are ungrateful.
And fight in Allah's cause and know well that Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Is there someone who will lend an excellent loan to Allah, so that He may increase it for him several times over? And Allah restricts and eases (the sustenance) – and it is to Him that you will return.
Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) not see a group of the Descendants of Israel, after Moosa? When they said to one of their Prophets (Shamueel – Samuel), “Appoint a king for us so that we may fight in Allah’s way”? He said, “Do you think you would refrain from fighting if it is made obligatory for you?” They said, “What is the matter with us that we should not fight in Allah’s cause, whereas we have been driven away from our homeland and our children?” So when fighting was ordained for them, they all turned away, except a few; and Allah is Well Aware of the unjust.
And their Prophet said to them, “Indeed Allah has sent Talut (Saul) as your king”; they said, “Why should he have kingship over us whereas we deserve the kingship more than he, and nor has he been given enough wealth?” He said, “Indeed Allah has chosen him above you, and has bestowed him with vast knowledge and physique”; and Allah may bestow His kingdom on whomever He wills; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.
And their Prophet said to them, “Indeed the sign of his kingdom will be the coming of a (wooden) box to you, in which from your Lord is the contentment of hearts and containing some souvenirs (remnants) left behind by the honourable Moosa and the honourable Haroon (Aaron), borne by the angels; indeed in it is a great sign* for you if you are believers.” (The remnants of pious persons are blessed by Allah.)
So when Talut left the city along with the armies, he said, “Allah will surely test you with a river; so whoever drinks its water is not mine – and whoever does not drink is mine – except him who takes it in the hollow of his hand”; so they all drank it, except a few of them; thereafter when Talut and the believers with him had crossed the river, they said, “We do not have power this day to face Jalut (Goliath) and his armies”; those who were certain of meeting Allah said, “Many a times has a smaller group overcome a bigger group by Allah’s command; and Allah is with the steadfast.”
And when they confronted Jalut and his armies they invoked, “Our Lord! Pour (bestow abundantly) on us patience (fortitude), and keep our feet steady, and help us against the disbelieving people.”
So they routed them by the command of Allah; and Dawud (David) slew Jalut, and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him all whatever He willed; and if Allah does not ward off some men by others, the earth will be destroyed, but Allah is Most Munificent towards the entire creation.
These are the verses of Allah, which We recite to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) with truth; and undoubtedly you are one of the Noble Messengers.
These are the Noble Messengers, to whom We gave excellence over each other; of them are some with whom Allah spoke, and some whom He exalted high above all others; and We gave Eisa (Jesus), the son of Maryam, clear signs and We aided him with the Holy Spirit; and if Allah willed, those after them would not have fought each other after the clear evidences had come to them, but they differed – some remained on faith and some turned disbelievers; and had Allah willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah may do as He wills.
O People who Believe! Spend in Allah's cause, from what We have provided you, before the advent of a day in which there is no trade, and for the disbelievers neither any friendship nor intercession; and the disbelievers themselves are the unjust.
Allah – there is no God except Him; He is Alive (eternally, on His own) and the Upholder (keeps others established); He never feels drowsy nor does He sleep; to Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; who is he that can intercede* with Him except by His command? He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them; and they do not achieve anything of His knowledge except what He wills; His Throne (of Sovereignty) encompasses the heavens and the earth; and it is not difficult for Him to guard them; and He is the Supreme, the Greatest. (This Verse is popularly known as Ayat Al-Kursi. It has a special status and reciting it carries great reward. *Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first one to be granted the permission to intercede, others will follow.)
There is no compulsion at all in religion; undoubtedly the right path has become very distinct from error; and whoever rejects faith in the devil (false deities) and believes in Allah has grasped a very firm handhold; it will never loosen; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Allah is the Guardian of the Muslims – He removes them from realms of darkness towards light; and the supporters of disbelievers are the devils – they remove them from light towards the realms of darkness; it is they who are the people of fire; they will remain in it forever.
Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) not see him who argued with Ibrahim (Abraham) concerning his Lord, as Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim said, “My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death”, he answered, “I give life and cause death”; Ibrahim said, “So indeed it is Allah Who brings the sun from the East – you bring it from the West!” – the disbeliever was therefore baffled; and Allah does not guide the unjust.
Or like him* who passed by a dwelling and it had fallen flat on its roofs; he said, “How will Allah bring it to life, after its death?”; so Allah kept him dead for a hundred years, then brought him back to life; He said, “How long have you stayed here?”; he replied, “I may have stayed for a day or little less”; He said, “In fact, you have spent a hundred years – so look at your food and drink which do not even smell stale; and look at your donkey whose bones even are not intact – in order that We may make you a sign for mankind – and look at the bones how We assemble them and then cover them with flesh”; so when the matter became clear to him, he said, “I know well that Allah is Able to do all things.” (Prophet Uzair – peace be upon him.)
And when Ibrahim said, “My Lord! Show me how You will give life to the dead”; He said, “Are you not certain (of it)?” Ibrahim said, “Surely yes, why not? But because I wish to put my heart at ease”; He said, “Therefore take four birds (as pets) and cause them to become familiar to you, then place a part of each of them on separate hills, then call them – they will come running towards you; and know well that Allah is Almighty, Wise.” (Prophet Ibrahim called the dead birds and they did come running towards him.)
The example of those who spend their wealth in Allah’s way is similar to that of a grain which has sprouted seven stalks and in each stalk are a hundred grains; and Allah may increase it still more than this, for whomever He wills; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.
Those who spend their wealth in Allah’s way and thereafter do not express favour nor cause injury (hurt the recipient’s feelings), their reward is with their Lord; there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
Speaking kind words and pardoning are better than charity followed by injury; and Allah is the Independent, Most Forbearing.
O People who Believe! Do not invalidate your charity by expressing favour and causing injury – like one who spends his wealth for people to see, and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day; his example is similar to that of a rock covered with dust and hard rain fell on it, leaving it as a bare rock; they shall get no control over (or benefit from) anything they have earned; and Allah does not guide the disbelievers.
And the example of those who spend their wealth in order to seek Allah’s pleasure and to make their hearts steadfast, is similar to that of a garden on a height – hard rain fell on it, so bringing forth its fruit twofold; so if hard rain does not reach it, the dew is enough; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
Would any of you like that he may own a garden of dates and grapes, with rivers flowing beneath it – in it are all kinds of fruits for him – and he reaches old age and has young children; therefore a windstorm containing fire came to the garden, burning it? This is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may give thought.
O People who Believe! Spend a part of your lawful earnings, and part of what We have produced from the earth for you – and do not (purposely) choose upon the flawed to give from it (in charity) whereas you would not accept it yourselves except with your eyes closed towards it; and know well that Allah is Independent, Most Praised.
The devil scares you of poverty and bids you to the shameful; and Allah promises you forgiveness from Him, and munificence; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.
Allah bestows wisdom on whomever He wills; and whoever receives wisdom has received abundant goodness; but none heed advice except men of understanding.
And whatever you spend or pledge to do, Allah is aware of it; and the unjust do not have supporters.
If you give charity openly, what an excellent deed it is! And if you secretly give it to the poor, it is the best for you; and it will redeem some of your sins; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
It is not your duty (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) to make them accept guidance – but Allah guides whomever He wills; and whatever good thing you spend is beneficial for yourselves; and it is not right for you to spend except to seek Allah’s pleasure; and whatever you spend will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged. –
(Spend) For the poor who are restricted while in Allah's cause, who cannot travel in the land (for earning) – the unwise think they are wealthy because of their restraint; you will recognise them by their faces; they do not seek from people in order to avoid grovelling; and Allah knows whatever you spend in charity.
Those who spend their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly – their reward is with their Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
Those who devour usury will not stand up on the Day of Judgement, except like the one whom an evil jinn has deranged by his touch; that is because they said, “Trade is also like usury!”; whereas Allah has made trading lawful and forbidden usury; for one to whom the guidance has come from his Lord, and he refrained therefrom, is lawful what he has taken in the past; and his affair is with Allah; and whoever continues earning it henceforth, is of the people of fire; they will remain in it for ages.
Allah destroys usury and increases charity; and Allah does not like any ungrateful, excessive sinner.
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds and kept the prayer established and paid the charity – their reward is with their Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah and forego the remaining usury, if you are Muslims.
And if you do not, then be certain of a war with Allah and His Noble Messenger; and if you repent, take back your principal amount; neither you cause harm to someone, nor you be harmed.
And if the debtor is in difficulty, give him respite till the time of ease; and your foregoing the entire debt from him is still better for you, if only you realise.
And fear the day in which you will be returned to Allah; and every soul will be paid back in full what it had earned, and they will not be wronged.
O People who Believe! If you make an agreement for debt for a specified time, write it down; and appoint a scribe to write it for you with accuracy; and the scribe must not refuse to write in the manner Allah has taught him, so he must write; and the liable person (debtor) should dictate it to him and fear Allah, Who is his Lord, and not hide anything of the truth; but if the debtor is of poor reasoning, or weak, or unable to dictate, then his guardian must dictate with justice; and appoint two witnesses from your men; then if two men are not available, one man and two women from those you would prefer to be witnesses, so that if one of them forgets, the other can remind her; and the witnesses must not refuse when called upon to testify; do not feel burdened to write it, whether the transaction is small or big – write it for up to its term’s end; this is closer to justice before Allah and will be a strong evidence and more convenient to dispel doubts amongst yourselves – except when it is an instant trade in which exchange is carried out immediately, there is no sin on you if it is not written down; and take witnesses whenever you perform trade; and neither the scribe nor the witnesses be caused any harm (or they cause any harm); and if you do, it would be an offence on your part; and fear Allah; and Allah teaches you; and Allah knows everything.
And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a mortgage (deposit) must be handed over; and if one of you trusts the other, the one who is trusted may return the mortgage entrusted to him and fear Allah, his Lord; and do not hide testimony; and if one hides it, his heart is sinful from within; and Allah knows what you do.
To Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and whether you disclose what is in your hearts or hide it, Allah will take account of it from you; so He will forgive whomever He wills and punish whomever He wills; and Allah is Able to do all things.
The Noble Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him by his Lord, and so do the believers; all have accepted faith in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Noble Messengers; saying, “We do not make any distinction, in believing, between any of His Noble Messengers”; and they said, “We hear, and we obey; Your forgiveness be granted, O our Lord, and towards You is our return.”
Allah does not burden anyone, except with something within its capacity; beneficial for it is the virtue it earned, and harmful for it is the evil it earned; “Our Lord! Do not seize us if we forget or are mistaken; our Lord! And do not place on us a heavy burden (responsibility) as You did on those before us; our Lord! And do not impose on us a burden, for which we do not have the strength; and pardon us – and forgive us – and have mercy on us – You are our Master, therefore help us against the disbelievers.”
