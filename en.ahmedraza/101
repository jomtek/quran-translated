The event that terrifies the hearts!
What is the event that terrifies the hearts?
And what have you understood, what the event that terrifies the hearts is!
The day when men will be like scattered moths.
And mountains will be like flying wool.
So for one whose scales prove heavy,
He is therefore in the desired bliss.
And for one whose scales prove light,
He is in the lap of one that abases.
And what have you understood, what the one that abases is!
A flaming fire!
