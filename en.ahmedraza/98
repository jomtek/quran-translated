The disbelieving People of the Book(s) and the polytheists would not have left their religion until the clear proof came to them.
(The clear proof is) the Noble Messenger from Allah, who reads the pure pages.
In which are written proper affairs.
Nor did the People of the Book(s) get divided until after the clear proof came to them.
And they were ordered only to worship Allah, believing purely in Him – devoted solely (to Him), and to establish the prayer and to pay the obligatory charity – and this is the straight religion.
Indeed all disbelievers, the People of the Book(s) and the polytheists, are in the fire of hell – they will remain in it for ever; it is they who are the worst among the creation.
Indeed those who accepted faith and did good deeds – it is they who are the best among the creation.
Their reward is – with their Lord – everlasting Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide for ever and ever; Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him; this is for one who fears his Lord.
