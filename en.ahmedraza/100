By oath of those that sprint, breathing heavily. (The horses used in Holy War.)
Striking stones with their hooves, sparking fire.
And by oath of those who raid at dawn.
So thereupon raising dust.
Then penetrate to the centre of the enemy army.
Indeed man is very ungrateful towards his Lord.
And indeed he himself is a witness to it.
And indeed he loves wealth to the extreme.
So does he not know? When those in the graves are raised,
And all what lies in the breasts is opened â€“
On that day their Lord surely knows all about them!
