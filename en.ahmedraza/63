When the hypocrites come in your presence (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) they say, “We testify that you surely are Allah’s Noble Messenger”; and Allah knows that you indeed are His Noble Messenger, and Allah testifies that the hypocrites are indeed liars.
They have taken their oaths as a shield, thereby prevented others from Allah’s way; indeed they commit extremely evil deeds.
That is because they accepted faith with their tongues then disbelieved with their hearts, therefore their hearts were sealed – so now they do not understand anything.
And when you see them, their appearance would please you; and when they speak, you would listen carefully to their speech; like wooden blocks propped against the wall; they assume every cry to be against them; they are the enemy, so beware of them; may Allah slay them! Where are they reverting!
And when it is said to them, “Come! Allah’s Noble Messenger may seek forgiveness for you” – they turn heads away, and you will see them turning away in pride.
It is the same for them, whether you seek forgiveness for them or do not seek forgiveness for them; Allah will never forgive them; indeed Allah does not guide the sinning people.
It is they who say, “Do not spend upon those who are with Allah’s Noble Messenger until they get distraught”; whereas to Allah only belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not have sense.
They say, “If we return to Medinah, then indeed the honourable group will soon expel the lowly one”; whereas all honour belongs to Allah and to His Noble Messenger and to the Muslims, but the hypocrites do not know.
O People who Believe! May not your wealth or your children cause you to neglect the remembrance of Allah; and whoever does this – so it is they who are in a loss.
And spend from what We have provided you before death approaches any one of you and he then says, “My Lord! Why did you not give me respite for a little while, so I would have given charity and become of the virtuous?”
And Allah will never give respite to any soul when its promise arrives; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
