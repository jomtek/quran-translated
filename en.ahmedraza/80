He frowned and turned away.
Because the blind man had come in his august presence.
And what do you know, he may be of the pure!
Or that he may accept advice, so the advice may benefit him.
For him who does not care,
So you are after him!
And you have nothing to lose if he does not become pure.
And for him who came to you striving,
And whereas he fears,
So you leave him, and are engrossed elsewhere!
Not this way – this is the advice.
So whoever wishes may remember it.
On honourable pages.
Exalted, pure.
Written by the hands of emissaries.
Who are noble, virtuous.
May man be slain – how ungrateful he is!
From what did He create him?
From a drop of liquid; He created him and then set several measures for him.
Then eased the way for him.
Then gave him death, so had him put in the grave.
Then, when He willed, He brought him out. (As during the night of Holy Prophet’s ascension, when all the Prophets gathered behind him in the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Or when Allah will raise everyone on the Day of Resurrection.)
Not one – he has not yet completed what he was commanded.
So man must look at his food.
That We watered it in abundance.
Then We split the earth properly.
Thereby produced grain in it.
And grapes and fodder,
And olives and date palms,
And dense gardens,
And fruits and grass,
In order to benefit you and your cattle.
So when the deafening Shout arrives,
On that day man will run away from his brother.
And from his mother and father,
And from his wife and sons.
On that day, each one has just one issue, which is enough for him.
Many a face will be glittering on that day.
Laughing, rejoicing.
And many a face will be covered with dust on that day.
Blackness overcoming them.
It is they, the disbelievers, the sinners.
