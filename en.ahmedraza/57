All whatever is in the heavens and in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
For Him only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes death; and He is Able to do all things.
He only is the First and He only the Last, and He only is the Evident and He only the Concealed; and it is He Who knows all things.
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then ascended the Throne (of Control), in a manner befitting His Majesty; He knows all what goes into the earth and all what comes out of it, and all what descends from the sky and all that rises in it; and He is with you, wherever you may be; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
For Him only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and towards Allah only is the return of all matters.
He brings the night in a part of the day, and brings the day in a part of the night; and He knows what lies within the hearts.
Accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and spend in His cause from what He has made you the heirs of; so for those among you who accepted faith and spent in His cause, is a great reward.
And what is the matter with you, that you should not accept faith in Allah? Whereas this Noble Messenger is calling you to believe in your Lord, and Allah has indeed already taken a covenant from you, if you believe.
It is He Who sends down clear verses upon His chosen bondman, in order to take you out from the realms of darkness towards light; and indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful upon you.
And what is the matter with you that you should not spend in Allah’s cause, whereas Allah is the Inheritor of all that is in the heavens and in the earth? Those among you who spent and fought before the conquest of Mecca are not equal to others; they are greater in rank than those who spent and fought after the conquest; and Allah has promised Paradise to all of them; and Allah well knows what you do.
Who will lend a handsome loan to Allah so that He may double it for him? And for such is an honourable reward.
The day when you will see the believing men and believing women, that their light runs before them and on their right – it being said to them, “This day, the best tidings for you are the Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abide in it forever; this is the greatest success.”
The day when hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to the Muslims, “Look mercifully towards us, so that we may gain some of your light!”; it will be said to them, “Turn back, search light over there!”; so they will turn around, whereupon a wall will be erected between them, in which is a gate; inside the gate is mercy, and on the outer side is the punishment.
The hypocrites will call out to the Muslims, “Were we not with you?”; they will answer, “Yes you were, why not? But you had put your souls into trial, and you used to await misfortune for the Muslims, and you doubted, and false hopes deceived you until Allah’s command came – and the big cheat had made you conceited towards the command of Allah.”
“So this day no ransom is to be taken from you nor from the declared disbelievers; your destination is the fire; that is your companion; and what a wretched outcome!”
Has not the time come for the believers to surrender their hearts to Allah’s remembrance and to this truth that has come down? And do not be like those who were earlier given the Book(s) and when a long term passed over them, their hearts became hardened; and many of them are sinners.
Know that it is Allah Who revives the earth after its death; We have indeed illustrated the signs for you, for you to understand.
Indeed the charity-giving men and women, and those who lend an excellent loan to Allah – for them is double, and for them is an honourable reward.
And those who believe in Allah and all His Noble Messengers, are the truly sincere; and are witness upon others, before their Lord; for them is their reward, and their light; and those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, are the people of hell.
Know that the life of this world is nothing but play and pastime, and adornment, and boasting amongst yourselves, and the desire to surpass each other in wealth and children; like the rain the produce of which pleased the farmer, then dried so you see it yellow, and then turned into dry trampled hay; and in the Hereafter is a severe punishment, and the forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure; and the life of this world is nothing but counterfeit wealth.
Rush towards the forgiveness of your Lord and a Paradise wide as the expanse of the heavens and the earth – made for those who believe in Allah and all His Noble Messengers; this is Allah’s munificence, He may bestow it to whomever He wills; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
There is no misfortune that reaches in the earth or in your selves but is mentioned in a Book, before We initiate it; indeed this is easy for Allah.
So that you may not be saddened upon losing something, nor rejoice upon what you are given; and Allah does not like any boastful, conceited person.
Those who practice miserliness, and exhort others to miserliness; and whoever turns away, then (know that) Allah is the Independent, the Most Praiseworthy.
Indeed We sent Our Noble Messengers with proofs, and sent down the Book and the Balance of Justice along with them, so that people may stay upon justice; and We sent down iron having severe heat and benefits for mankind, and so that Allah may see him, who without seeing aides Him and His Noble Messengers; indeed Allah is Almighty, Dominant.
And indeed We sent Nooh and Ibrahim, and placed Prophethood and the Book among their descendants, so some among them took to guidance; and many of them are sinners.
We then sent Our other Noble Messengers after them following their footsteps, and after them We sent Eisa, the son of Maryam, and bestowed the Injeel to him; and We instilled compassion and mercy in the hearts of his followers; and they invented monasticism which We had not ordained upon them only to seek Allah’s pleasure, then did not properly abide by it as it should have been rightfully abided; We therefore gave the believers among them their reward; and many of them are sinners.
O People who Believe (in the earlier Noble Messengers)! Fear Allah and accept faith in this Noble Messenger of His – He will bestow two portions of His mercy to you and will create a light for you to walk in it, and will forgive you; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
This is so that the disbelievers among People given the Book(s) may know that they do not have any control over Allah’s munificence, and that the munificence is in Allah’s Hand (control) – He bestows to whomever He wills; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
