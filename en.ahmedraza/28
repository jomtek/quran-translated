These are verses of the clear Book.
We shall narrate to you the true tidings of Moosa and Firaun, for the people who have faith.
Indeed Firaun had achieved dominance in the earth and made its people subservient to him – seeing a group among them weak, he used to kill their sons and spare their women; he was indeed very mischievous.
And We willed to favour those who were weak in the earth, and to make them leaders and to make them the inheritors (of the land and wealth of Firaun’s people).
And to give them control in the land, and to show Firaun and Haman and their armies what they fear from them.
And We inspired the mother of Moosa that, “Suckle him; then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve; We shall indeed return him back to you and make him one of the Noble Messengers.”
So the family of Firaun picked him up, in order that he become their enemy and a sorrow upon them; indeed Firaun and Haman and their armies were guilty.
And Firaun’s wife said, “This child is the comfort of my eyes and yours*; do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as our son” – and they were unaware. (Had Firaun also said the same, Allah would have granted him faith.)
And in the morning, the heart of Moosa’s mother became impatient; and she would have almost certainly given away his secret had We not strengthened her heart, so that she may have faith in Our promise.
And she said to his sister, “Go after him” – she therefore observed him from far, and they were not aware.
And We had already forbidden suckle-nurses for him, so she said, “Shall I show you a household that will nurse this child of yours, and they are his well-wishers?”
So We returned him to his mother in order to soothe her eyes and not grieve, and to know that Allah’s promise is true – but most people do not know.
And when he reached his maturity and full strength, We gave him wisdom and knowledge; and this is how We reward the virtuous.
And he entered the city when its inhabitants were sleeping unaware in the afternoon – he therefore found two men fighting; one was from Moosa’s group, and the other from among his enemies; so the one who was of Moosa’s group pleaded to Moosa for help against him who was of his enemies – therefore Moosa punched him thereby finishing him; he said, “This act was from the devil*; indeed he is an open enemy, a misleader.” (* The act of oppressing the man from Bani Israel).
He said, “My Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul* therefore forgive me” – He therefore forgave him; indeed only He is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful. (* By getting angry.)
He said, “My Lord! The way You have bestowed favour upon me, so never will I be a supporter of the guilty.”
So he was in the city at morning fearing, waiting to see what happens – thereupon he sighted the one who had appealed to him the day before, crying out to him for help; Moosa said to him, “Indeed you are clearly astray.”
So when Moosa wished to apprehend the man who was an enemy to them both, he said, “O Moosa! Do you wish to kill me the way you killed a man yesterday? You only wish to become a strict ruler in the land, and not to make reform.”
And a man came running from the outer part of the city; he said, “O Moosa! Indeed the court members are considering killing you, therefore go away – I surely am your well-wisher.”
So he left the city in fear, waiting to see what happens; he said, “My Lord! Rescue me from the unjust people.”
And when he turned his attention towards Madyan he said, “It is likely that my Lord will show me the right path.”
And when he came to the water of Madyan he found a group of men, watering their animals; and away from them he found two women restraining their animals; he said, “What is the matter with you?” They said, “We do not water our animals till all the shepherds water and take away their animals; and our father is very old.”
Therefore Moosa watered their animals for them, and then turned towards the shade and said, “My Lord! I am in need of the sustenance you may send down for me.”
So one of the two women approached him, walking shyly; she said, “My father is calling you, in order to give you wages because you watered our animals for us”; when Moosa came to him and had told him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you are safe from the unjust people.”
One of the two women said, “O my father! Employ him – indeed a strong and trustworthy employee is better.”
He said, “I wish to give you one of these two daughters of mine in marriage, the bridal money being that you work for me for eight years; then if you complete ten years, it will be from you; and I do not wish to put you in hardship; Allah willing, you will probably find me of the righteous.”
Said Moosa, “This is agreed between me and you; there shall be no claim upon me if I fulfil any of these two terms; and Allah is the Trustee upon this word of ours.”
So when Moosa completed his term and was travelling with his wife, he saw a fire in the direction of the Mount (Sinai); he said to his wife “Stay here – I have sighted a fire in the direction of the mount – perhaps I may bring you some news from it, or an ember so that you may warm yourselves.”
And when he reached the fire, he was called out to from the right side of the valley in the blessed field, from the tree, “O Moosa! Indeed I am truly Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
“Put down your staff”; so when Moosa saw it writhing like a serpent, he turned moving away without looking back; “O Moosa! Come forth and do not fear; indeed you are in peace.”
“Put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white, not due to any illness; and put your hand on your chest to remove the fear – so these are two proofs from your Lord to Firaun and his court members; indeed they are a lawless people.”
He submitted, “My Lord! I killed a soul among them and I fear they will kill me.”
“And my brother Haroon – he is more eloquent than I am in speech, therefore in order to help me, appoint him as a Noble Messenger so that he confirms me; I fear that they will deny me.”
He said, “We will soon strengthen your arm with your brother, and give you both dominance, so they will not be able to harm you; due to Our signs; you both, and those who will follow you, will be victorious.”
Therefore when Moosa came to them with Our clear signs they said, “This is nothing but invented magic, and we never heard anything like this among our forefathers.”
And said Moosa, “My Lord well knows him who has brought guidance from Him, and for whom will be the abode the Hereafter; indeed the unjust never attain success.”
And Firaun said, “O court members! I do not know of any other God for you, except myself; therefore, O Haman, build a lofty palace for me by baking concrete in order that I may sneak a look at the God of Moosa – and according to me, he is indeed a liar.”
And he and his soldiers wrongfully sought greatness in the land, and assumed they would never be brought back to Us.
We therefore seized him and his armies, and hurled them into the sea; therefore see what sort of fate befell the unjust!
And We made them leaders of the people of hell, inviting towards the fire; and they will not be helped on the Day of Resurrection.
And We set a curse after them in this world; and evil is for them on the Day of Resurrection.
And We indeed gave Moosa the Book after We had destroyed the former generations, having enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, for them to accept advice.
And you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) were not on the western side of the Mount when We sent the command of Prophethood to Moosa, and you were not present. (Yet you narrate the account very clearly to the Jews and Christians.)
However, We created generations and ages passed by upon them; and nor were you dwelling with the people of Madyan reciting Our verses to them – however it is We Who made the Noble Messengers.
And nor were you beside the Mount when We proclaimed – however it is a mercy from your Lord* so that you may warn a nation towards whom no Herald of Warning came before you, in the hope of their heeding advice. (*That He has bestowed knowledge of the hidden to you)
Otherwise, if some disaster befell them because of what their own hands have sent forward they would say, “Our Lord! Why did you not send a Noble Messenger towards us, so we may have followed Your signs and accepted faith?”
So when the Truth* from Us came to them, they said, “Why has he not been given what was given to Moosa?” Had they not disbelieved in what was earlier given to Moosa? They said, “They are two magicians, who support each other”; and said, “We disbelieve in both of them.” (* Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him).
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Therefore bring a Book from Allah which is better guiding than these two – I will follow it – if you are truthful.”
So if they do not accept your challenge, then know that they only follow their desires; and who is more astray than one who follows his desires away from the guidance of Allah? Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.
And We indeed sent down the Word continuously for them, so that they may ponder.
Those to whom We gave the Book before it, accept faith in it. (Some scholars among Jews / Christians).
And when these verses are recited to them, they say, “We accept faith in it – indeed it is the Truth from our Lord – and indeed we had surrendered even before this.”
They will be given double the reward, the recompense of their patience – and they repel evil with good, and spend part of what We have provided them.
And when they hear indecent speech, they ignore it and say, “For us are our deeds and for you are your deeds; peace be to you (good bye); we are not interested in the ignorant.”
Indeed it is not such that you can guide whomever you love, but Allah guides whomever He wills; and He well knows the people upon guidance.
And they say, “If we follow the guidance along with you, people would snatch us away from our land”; did We not establish them in a safe Sacred Land, towards which are brought fruits of all kinds – the sustenance from Us? But most of them do not know.
And how many towns did We destroy which had stooped to self indulgence! So here lie their dwellings, uninhabited after them except a little; and only We are the Inheritors.
And never does your Lord destroy towns until He sends a Noble Messenger to their principal town, reciting Our verses to them; and We never destroy towns unless its people are unjust.
And whatever you have been given, is a usage in the life of this world and its adornment; and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting; so do you not have sense?
So is he whom We have given a good promise – he will therefore get it – equal to him whom We gave the usage of the life of this world to enjoy, and who will then be brought captive on the Day of Resurrection?
On the day when He will call to them – He will therefore proclaim, “Where are those partners of Mine, whom you had assumed?”
Those against whom the Word will have proved true will say, “Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray; we led them astray the way we ourselves went astray; we are unconcerned with them and we incline towards You – they never worshipped us!”
And it will be said to them, “Call unto your ascribed partners” – so they will call unto them and they will not listen to them, and they will behold the punishment; if only they had obtained guidance!
And on the Day when He will call to them and proclaim, “What answer did you give to the Noble Messengers?”
So on that Day the tidings will be blinded* for them, therefore they will not ask one another. (* They will forget at that moment).
So whoever repented and accepted faith and did good deeds, so it is likely that he will be among the successful.
And your Lord creates whatever He wills, and chooses; they do not have any power to choose; Purity and Supremacy are to Allah above their ascribing partners (to Him).
And your Lord knows what is hidden in their breasts, and what they disclose.
And He is Allah – there is no God except Him; only His is the praise in this world and in the Hereafter; and only His is the command, and it is towards Him that you will be returned.
Proclaim, “What is your opinion – if Allah makes it night continuously for you till the Day of Resurrection then, other than Allah, who is the God who could bring you light? So do you not heed?”
Say, “What is your opinion – if Allah makes it day continuously for you till the Day of Resurrection then, other than Allah, who is the God who could bring you night for you to rest during it? So do you not perceive?”
And with His mercy He made the night and day for you, so that you may rest during the night and seek His munificence during the day, and for you to be thankful.
On the day when He will call to them – He will therefore proclaim, “Where are those partners of Mine, whom you had assumed?”
And We shall proclaim taking out a witness from each group, “Bring your proof” – so they will realise that the Truth (Right) is for Allah, and they will lose all that they had fabricated.
Indeed Qaroon was from the people of Moosa – he then oppressed them; and We gave him so many treasures that their keys were a heavy burden for a strong group; when his people said to him, “Do not show off – indeed Allah does not like the boastful.”
“And seek the abode of the Hereafter with the wealth that Allah has given you, and do not forget your part in this world, and do favours (to others) the way Allah has favoured you, and do not seek to cause turmoil in the earth; indeed Allah does not like the mischievous.”
He said, “I got this only due to a knowledge I have”; and does he not know that before him Allah destroyed the generations who were stronger than him and more in number? And there is no questioning of the guilty regarding their sins.
He therefore came before his people in his pomp; said those who desired the worldly life, “If only we were to get what Qaroon has been given – he is indeed very fortunate.”
And said those who were given the knowledge, “Woe to you – the reward of Allah is better for one who accepts faith and does good deeds; and only those who are patient will receive it.”
We therefore buried him and his house into the earth; so he had no group to help save him from Allah; nor could he take revenge.
And those who had the day before desired his status, said in the morning, “It is strange – Allah expands the sustenance for whomever He wills among His bondmen, and restricts it; if Allah had not been gracious to us He would have buried us too; strangely, the disbelievers do not prosper.”
This abode of the Hereafter – We make it for those who do not wish greatness in the land nor turmoil; and the Hereafter is only for the pious.
Whoever brings virtue, for him is better than it; and whoever brings evil – so those who commit evil will not be repaid except to the extent of their deeds.
Indeed He Who has ordained the Qur’an upon you, will surely bring you back to where you wish; proclaim, “My Lord well knows him who came with guidance, and him who is in open error.”
And you held no expectations of the Book being sent down upon you, except that it is a mercy from your Lord – therefore never support the disbelievers. (You did not crave for it but trusted in the mercy of your Lord).
And never may they prevent you from the verses of Allah after they have been sent down upon you, and call towards your Lord, and never be among those who ascribe partners (to Him).
And do not worship any other God along with Allah; there is no God except Him; all things are destructible except His Entity; only His is the command, and it is towards Him that you will be returned.
