When the heaven breaks apart.
And it listens to the command of its Lord – and that befits it.
And when the earth is spread out.
And it unburdens itself of all that is in it, and becomes empty.
And it listens to the command of its Lord – and that befits it.
O man, indeed you have to surely run towards your Lord, and to meet him.
So whoever is given his record of deeds in his right hand –
Soon an easy account will be taken from him.
And he will return to his family rejoicing.
And whoever is given his record of deeds behind his back –
Soon he will pray for death.
And will go into the blazing fire.
Indeed he used to rejoice in his home.
He assumed that he does not have to return.
Surely yes, why not? Indeed his Lord is seeing him.
So by oath of the late evening’s light.
And by oath of the night and all that gathers in it.
And by oath of the moon when it is full.
You will surely go up level by level.
What is the matter with them that they do not accept faith?
And when the Qur’an is recited to them, they do not fall prostrate? (Command of Prostration # 13)
In fact the disbelievers keep denying.
And Allah well knows what they conceal in their hearts.
Therefore give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
Except those who believed and did good deeds – for them is a reward that will never end.
