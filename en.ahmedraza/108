We have indeed bestowed the Kausar* upon you (O dear prophet Mohammed â€“ peace and blessings be upon him). (*Infinite excellent qualities / the greatest number of followers / the sweet pond on the Day of Resurrection)
So offer the prayers for your Lord, and perform the sacrifice.
Indeed it is your enemy who is bereft of all goodness.
