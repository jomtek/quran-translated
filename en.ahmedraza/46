Ha-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
The sending down of this Book is from Allah the Most Honourable, the Wise.
We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with the truth, and for a fixed term; and the disbelievers have turned away from what they are warned!
Proclaim, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What is your opinion – regarding those whom you worship other than Allah – show me which part of the earth they have created, or do they own any portion of the heavens? Bring to me a Book preceding this (Qur’an), or some remnants of knowledge, if you are truthful.”
And who is more astray than one who worships those, instead of Allah, who cannot listen to their prayer until* the Day of Resurrection, and who do not even know of their worship! (Will never listen.)
And on the day when people are gathered, they will become their enemies, and will reject their worshippers. (The idols will give testimony against the polytheists.)
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say regarding the Truth that has come to them, “This is an obvious magic!”
What! They dare say, “He has fabricated it”? Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “If I have fabricated it, then (I know that) you have no power to support me against Allah; He well knows the matters you are involved in; He is Sufficient as a Witness between me and you; and He only is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”
Say, “I am not something new* among the Noble Messengers, nor do I know (on my own) what will happen to me** or with you; I only follow that which is divinely revealed to me, and I am purely a Herald of clear warning. (* I am like the earlier ones. ** My knowledge comes due to divine revelations.)
Say, “What is your opinion – if the Qur’an is from Allah and you have rejected faith in it, and a witness among the Descendants of Israel has already testified upon this and accepted faith, while you became arrogant? Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.”
And the disbelievers said regarding the Muslims, “If there were any good in it, the Muslims would not have surpassed us in achieving it!”; and since they did not receive guidance with it, they will now say, “This is an old slander.”
And whereas before this exists the Book of Moosa, a guide and a mercy; and this is a Book giving testimony, in the Arabic language, to warn the unjust; and to give glad tidings to the virtuous.
Indeed those who said, “Allah is our Lord”, and then remained steadfast – upon them is neither any fear nor shall they grieve.
They are the People of Paradise, abiding in it forever; the reward of their deeds.
And We have commanded man to be good towards parents; his mother bore him with hardship, and delivered him with hardship; and carrying him and weaning him is for thirty months; until when he* reached maturity and became forty years of age, he said, “My Lord! Inspire me to be thankful for the favours you bestowed upon me and my parents, and that I may perform the deeds pleasing to You, and keep merit among my offspring; I have inclined towards you and I am a Muslim.” (* This verse was revealed concerning S. Abu Bakr – the first caliph, R. A. A)
These are the ones whose good deeds We will accept, and overlook their shortfalls – among the People of Paradise; a true promise which is being given to them.
And the one who said to his parents, “Uff – I am fed up with both of you! What! You promise me that I will be raised again whereas generations have passed away before me?” And they both seek Allah’s help and say to him, “May you be ruined, accept faith! Indeed Allah’s promise is true”; he therefore answers, “This is nothing except stories of former people.”
It is these upon whom the Word has proved true, among the nations that passed away before them, of jinns and men; indeed they were losers.
And for all persons are ranks according to their deeds; and so that He may repay them in full for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.
And on the day when the disbelievers will be presented upon the fire; it will be said to them, “You have wasted your portion of the good things in the life of this world and enjoyed them; so this day you will be repaid with the disgraceful punishment, the recompense of your wrongfully priding yourself in the land, and because you used to disobey.”
And remember the fellowman of the tribe of A’ad; when he warned his nation in the Ahqaf* – and indeed Heralds of warning passed away before and after him – that, “Do not worship anyone except Allah; indeed I fear the punishment of a Great Day upon you. (* A country among sand dunes.)
They said, “Have you come to us in order to turn us away from our Gods? Therefore bring upon us what you promise us, if you are truthful.”
He said, “Its knowledge is only with Allah; and I convey to you the messages of my Lord, but I perceive that you are an ignorant nation.”
So when they saw the punishment coming towards their valleys, spread like a cloud on the horizon, they said, “That is a cloud which will shower rain upon us”; said Hud “In fact this is what you were being impatient for; a windstorm carrying a painful punishment.”
“That destroys all things by the command of its Lord” – so at morning none could be seen except their empty houses; this is the sort of punishment We mete out to the guilty.
And We had indeed given them the means which We have not given you, and made ears and eyes and hearts for them; so their ears and eyes and hearts did not benefit them at all because they used to deny the signs of Allah, and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them.
And We indeed destroyed townships surrounding you, and brought several signs so that they may desist.
So why did they – the ones whom they had chosen as Gods as a means of attaining Allah’s proximity – not help them? In fact the disbelievers lost them; and this is just their slander and fabrication.
And when We sent a number of jinns towards you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), listening attentively to the Qur’an; so when they presented themselves there, they said to each other, “Listen quietly!”; and when the recitation finished, they turned back to their people, giving them warning.
They said, “O our people! We have indeed heard a Book, sent down after Moosa, which confirms the Books preceding it, and guides towards the Truth and the Straight Path.”
“O our people! Listen to Allah’s caller and accept faith in Him, so that He may forgive you some of your sins and save you from the painful punishment.”
“And whoever does not listen to Allah’s caller cannot escape in the earth, and he has no supporters against Allah; they are in open error.”
Have they not realised that Allah, Who did not tire in creating the heavens and the earth and in creating them, is Able to revive the dead? Surely yes, why not? Indeed He is Able to do all things.
And on the day when the disbelievers are presented upon the fire; it will be said, “Is this not a reality?” They will answer, “By oath of our Lord, surely yes, why not?”; it will be said, “Therefore taste the punishment, the recompense of your disbelief.”
Therefore patiently endure (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) like the courageous Noble Messengers had endured, and do not be impatient for them; on the day when they see what they are promised, it will be as if they had not stayed on earth except part of a day; this is to be conveyed; will anyone be destroyed, except the disobedient?
