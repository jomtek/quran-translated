By oath of the late morning,
And by oath of the night when it covers,
Your Lord has not forsaken you nor does He dislike you!
And indeed the latter is better for you than the former.
And indeed your Lord will soon give you so much that you will be pleased. (Allah seeks to please the Holy Prophet â€“ peace and blessings be upon him.)
Did He not find you an orphan, so provided you shelter?
And found you deeply engrossed in His love, so directed you?
And found you in need, so made you prosperous?
Therefore do not oppress the orphan.
And do not rebuke the beggar.
And abundantly proclaim the favours of your Lord.
