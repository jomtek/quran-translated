O dear Prophet (Mohammed â€“ peace and blessings be upon him), did you not see how did your Lord deal with the People of the Elephant?
Did He not put their scheme into ruin?
And send flocks of birds upon them,
Which hit them with stones of baked clay,
So He made them like the leftover devoured leaves of farms?
