I swear by this city (Mecca) –
For you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) are in this city.
And by oath of your forefather Ibrahim, and by you – his illustrious son!
We have indeed created man surrounded by hardships.
Does man think that no one will ever have power over him?
He says, “I destroyed vast wealth.”
Does man think that no one saw him?
Did We not make two eyes for him?
And a tongue and two lips?
And did We not guide him to the two elevated things?
So he did not quickly enter the steep valley.
And what have you understood, what the valley is!
The freeing of a slave!
Or the feeding on a day of hunger.
Of a related orphan,
Or of a homeless needy person!
And moreover to be of those who accepted faith, and who urged patience to one another and who urged graciousness to one another.
These are the people of the right.
And those who denied Our signs, are the people of the left.
Upon them is a fire, in which they are imprisoned, closed and shut above them.
