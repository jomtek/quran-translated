Allah has destroyed the deeds of those who disbelieved and prevented from Allah’s way.
And those who accepted faith and did good deeds and believed in what has been sent down upon Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) – and that is the truth from their Lord – Allah has relieved them of some of their evils and refined their condition.
This is because the disbelievers followed falsehood and the believers followed the Truth which is from their Lord; this is how Allah illustrates the examples of people to them.
So when you confront the disbelievers, strike at their necks; until when you have slain them in plenty, tie them up firmly; then after that, you may either release them as a favour or take ransom, until the war lays down its ordeal; this is it; and had Allah willed He Himself could have taken revenge from them, but this is to test some of you with others; and Allah will surely never waste the deeds of those who were killed in His way.
He will soon guide them (towards Paradise) and make them succeed.
And He will admit them into Paradise – they have been made familiar with it.
O People who Believe! If you help the religion of Allah, He will help you and will stabilise you.
And for those who disbelieve – may they be ruined, and may Allah destroy all their deeds!
This is because they disliked what Allah has sent down – He has therefore squandered all their deeds.
So did they not travel in the land to see what sort of fate befell those who preceded them? Allah poured ruin upon them; and for the disbelievers are several like it.
This is because Allah is the Supporter of the believers, whereas the disbelievers do not have any supporter.
Allah will indeed admit those who believed and did good deeds into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and the disbelievers enjoy, and they eat like the cattle eat, and their destination is in the fire.
And many a township existed which was stronger than your town (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) – those who removed you from your town – We destroyed them, so they do not have a supporter!
So will one who is upon on a clear proof from his Lord, ever be like any of those whose evil deeds are made to appear good to them and they follow their own desires?
A description of the Garden which is promised to the pious; in it are rivers of water which shall never pollute; and rivers of milk the taste of which shall never change; and rivers of wine delicious to drink; and rivers of purified honey; and in it for them are fruits of all kinds, and the forgiveness of their Lord; so will such ever be equal to those who are to stay in the fire for ever and who will be given boiling water to drink so that it tears their guts apart?
And among them are some who listen to what you say; until when they go away from you, they say to those who have been given knowledge, “What did he say now?”; they are those whose hearts Allah has sealed, and they follow their own desires.
And those who attained the right path – Allah increases the guidance for them and bestows their piety to them.
So what are they waiting for, except that the Last Day suddenly come upon them? For its signs have already appeared; so when it does come, of what use is their realising it?
Therefore know (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and seek the forgiveness of sins of your close ones and for the common believing men and women; and Allah knows your movements during the day and your resting during the night.
And the Muslims say, “Why was not a chapter sent down?” So when a positive chapter was sent down, and war was commanded in it, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at you with the dazed looks of a dying man; so it would be better for them. –
To obey and speak good; so when the manifest command came – it would have been better for them if they had remained faithful to Allah.
So do you* portray that if you get governance, you would spread chaos in the land and sever your relations? (* The hypocrites)
It is these whom Allah has cursed, so He made them deaf to the Truth and blinded their eyes.
So do they not ponder the Qur’an deeply, or are there locks on some of their hearts?
Indeed those who turn back after the guidance had become clear to them – Satan has deceived them; and made them optimistic of living for ages.
This is because they said to those who dislike what Allah has sent down, “We will obey you regarding one matter*”; and Allah knows their secrets. (* To fight against the Holy Prophet).
So how (dreadful) will it be when the angels remove their souls, striking at their faces and their backs!
This is because they followed the matter which displeases Allah, and they disliked what pleases Him – He therefore squandered away all their deeds.
What! Do they, in whose hearts is a disease, fancy that Allah will not expose concealed enmities?
And if We will, We can show them to you so that you may recognise them by their faces; and you will surely recognise them by the way they talk; and Allah knows your deeds.
And We shall indeed test you until We make known the warriors and the steadfast among you – and to test your proclamations.
Indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from Allah’s way, and opposed the Noble Messenger after the guidance had become clear to them – they cannot harm Allah in the least; and soon He will squander away their deeds.
O People who Believe! Obey Allah and obey the Noble Messenger, and do not render your deeds void.
Indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from Allah’s way, and then died as disbelievers – so Allah will never forgive them.
Therefore do not relax, nor call towards truce by yourself; and it is you who will dominate; and Allah is with you, and He will never cause a loss in your deeds.
The worldly life is just a sport and pastime; and if you accept faith and be pious, He will bestow your rewards to you, and not at all ask you for your wealth.
Were He to ask it from you, and ask in plenty, you would be miserly, and the miserliness would expose the filth within your hearts.
Yes, undoubtedly it is you who are being called, that you may spend in Allah’s way; so some among you act miserly; and whoever is miserly, is being a miser upon himself; and Allah is the Independent (Wealthy – Not requiring anything), whereas you all are needy; and if you renege, He will replace you with other people – and they will not be like you.
