By oath of the heaven, and by oath of the nightly arriver.
And have you understood what the nightly arriver is?
The very brightly shining star!
There is not a soul that does not have a guardian over it.
So man must consider from what he has been created.
Created from a gushing fluid.
That is issued from between the backs and the ribs.
Indeed Allah is Able to return him.
A day when the secrets will be examined.
So man will neither have any strength nor any aide.
By oath of the sky from which comes down the rain.
And by oath of the earth which flourishes with it.
Indeed the Qur’an is a decisive Word.
And is not a matter of amusement.
Indeed the disbelievers carry out their evil schemes.
And I secretly plan.
Therefore give them some respite – give them some time.
