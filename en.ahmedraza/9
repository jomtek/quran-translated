Severance of ties is proclaimed by Allah and on behalf of His Noble Messenger, towards the polytheists with whom you had a treaty.
Travel freely in the land for four months, and bear in mind that you cannot escape from Allah, and that Allah will humiliate the disbelievers.
And proclaim from Allah and His Noble Messenger to all men on the day of the Great Pilgrimage (Haj) that Allah is disgusted with the polytheists, and so is His Noble Messenger; so if you repent it is better for you; but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape from Allah; and give the disbelievers the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
Other than those polytheists with whom you had a treaty, and they have not diminished anything from your treaty nor supported anyone against you – therefore fulfil their treaty up to the appointed term; indeed Allah befriends the pious.
Then when the sacred months have passed, slay the polytheists wherever you find them, and catch them and make them captive, and wait in ambush for them at every place; then if they repent and keep the prayer established and pay the charity, leave their way free; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), if a polytheist seeks your protection, give him protection so that he may hear the Word of Allah, and then transport him to his place of safety; this is because they are an unwise people.
How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His Noble Messenger for the polytheists, except for those with whom you made a treaty near the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they remain firm on the treaty for you, you too remain firm for them; indeed Allah is pleased with the pious.
Therefore how – when they are such that if they gain control over you, they would not have regard for any relations nor for any treaty? They please you with their mouths whereas their hearts contain rejection; and most of them are disobedient.
They exchanged the verses of Allah for an abject price, therefore prevented from His way; indeed what they do is extremely evil.
In respect of the Muslims, they do not keep regard for any relations nor any pacts; it is they who are the rebels.
Then if they repent and keep the prayer established and pay the charity, they are your brothers in religion; and we explain Our verses in detail for the people of knowledge.
And if they break their promises after making a treaty and malign your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief – indeed their promises are nothing – in the hope that they may desist.
Will you not fight the people who broke their promises, and intended to expel the Noble Messenger whereas they had started it? Do you fear them? So Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you have faith.
So fight them – Allah will punish them at your hands, and He will disgrace them and assist you over them, and He will soothe the hearts of the believers.
And He will remove the anxiety of their hearts; and Allah may accept the repentance of whomever He wills; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
Are you under the illusion that you would be left just like this, whereas Allah has not yet made known those of you who will fight and not confide their secrets with anyone except Allah and His Noble Messenger and the Muslims? And Allah is Well Aware of your deeds.
It does not befit the polytheists to assemble in Allah’s mosques after themselves bearing witness of their disbelief; in fact all their deeds are wasted; and they will remain in the fire forever.
Only those enliven the mosques of Allah who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish prayer and pay the obligatory charity and fear none except Allah – so it is likely that they will be among the people of guidance.
So have they taken the quenching of the pilgrims’ thirst and servicing of the Sacred Mosque as equal (in merit) to him who accepted faith in Allah and the Last Day, and fought in Allah’s way? They are not equal before Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust.
Those who accepted faith, and left their homes and fought with their wealth and their lives in Allah’s way have a greater rank before Allah; and it is they who have succeeded.
Their Lord gives them the glad tidings of His mercy and His pleasure, and the Gardens in which are everlasting favours for them.
They will abide in it for ever and ever; indeed with Allah is the great reward.
O People who Believe! Do not consider your fathers and your brothers as your friends if they prefer disbelief over faith; and whoever among you befriends them – then it is he who is the unjust.
Say, “If your fathers, and your sons, and your brothers, and your wives, and your tribe, and your acquired wealth, and the trade in which you fear a loss, and the houses of your liking – if all these are dearer to you than Allah and His Noble Messenger and fighting in His way, then wait until Allah brings about His command; and Allah does not guide the sinful.”
Indeed Allah helped you on many occasions – and on the day of Huneyn – when you prided in your multitude, so it did not benefit you at all, and the earth despite being vast became restricted for you – then you turned back and returned.
Then Allah sent down His calm upon His Noble Messenger and upon the Muslims, and sent down armies you did not see, and punished the disbelievers; and such is the reward of the deniers.
Then afterwards Allah will give repentance to whomever He wills; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! The polytheists are utterly filthy*; so after this year do not let them come near the Sacred Mosque; and if you fear poverty**, then Allah will soon make you wealthy with His grace, if He wills; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise. (* Filthy in body and soul. **Due to loss of trade.)
Fight against the People given the Book(s) who do not accept faith in Allah and the Last Day, and who do not treat as forbidden what is forbidden by Allah and by His Noble Messenger, and who do not follow the true religion, until they pay the tariff with their own hands with humiliation.
And the Jews said, “Uzair is the son of Allah”, and the Christians said “The Messiah is the son of Allah”; they utter this from their own mouths; they speak like the former disbelievers; may Allah kill them; where are they reverting!
They have taken their rabbis and their monks as Gods besides Allah and (also) Messiah the son of Maryam; and they were not commanded except to worship only One God – Allah; none is worthy of worship except Him; Purity is to Him from all that they ascribe as partners (to Him).
They wish to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will not agree except that He will perfect His light, even if the disbelievers get annoyed.
It is He Who has sent His Noble Messenger with guidance and the true religion, in order to prevail over all other religions – even if the polytheists get annoyed.
O People who Believe! Indeed many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks unjustly devour people's wealth and prevent from Allah’s way; and those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah’s way – so them give the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
The day when it will be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with them; “Here is what you hoarded for yourselves; so now taste the joy of your hoarding!”
Indeed the number of months before Allah is twelve – in the Book of Allah – since the day He created the heavens and the earth, of which four are sacred; this the straight religion; so do not wrong yourselves in those months; and constantly fight against the polytheists as they constantly fight against you; and know well that Allah is with the pious.
Their postponing of the months is nothing but furtherance in disbelief – the disbelievers are misled by it – they decree it lawful in one year and regard it forbidden in another year, in order to equate to the number of the months which Allah has made sacred, and to make lawful what Allah has forbidden; their evil deeds seem good in their sight; and Allah does not guide the disbelievers.
O People who Believe! What is the matter with you, that when it is said to you, “Migrate in Allah's cause”, you sit on the ground with heaviness? Have you preferred this worldly life over the Hereafter? And the wealth of the life of this world, in comparison with the Hereafter, is but only a little.
If you do not migrate, He will afflict you with a painful punishment and bring other people in your stead and you will not be able to harm Him in the least; and Allah is Able to do all things.
If you do not help him (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), Allah has helped him – when he had to go forth due to the mischief of the disbelievers, just as two men* – when they were in the cave, when he was saying to his companion “Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us”; then Allah caused His calm to descend upon him and helped him with armies you did not see, and disgraced the word of the disbelievers; and Allah’s Word is supreme; and Allah is the Almighty, the Wise. (* The Holy Prophet migrated only with S. Abu Bakr (who later became the first caliph) as his sole companion.)
Migrate – whether willingly or with a heavy heart and fight in Allah's cause with your wealth and your lives; this is better for you, if you realise.
Had there been some wealth near at hand or a short journey, they would have certainly accompanied you, but the difficult path became very distant for them; and they will now swear by Allah that “Had we been able, we would have surely accompanied you”; they destroy their own souls; and Allah knows that undoubtedly, they are indeed liars.
May Allah forgive you*; why did you permit them** until the truthful ones had been manifested to you and the liars been exposed? (* This is an expression of love for the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him. ** The hypocrites had been permitted to stay back from the holy war.)
And those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not seek exemption from you for not fighting with their wealth and their lives; and Allah well knows the pious.
Only those ask for such an exemption from you who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt – so they waver in their doubts.
And if going forth were acceptable to them, they would have made preparations for it, but Allah Himself disliked their getting up (to fight) so He filled them with laze and it was said “Continue sitting with those who remain seated.”
If they had gone forth among you, you would then not gain any increase from them except trouble, and seeking to cause turmoil they would run rumours among you; and their spies are among you; and Allah well knows the unjust.
Indeed they had sought to cause turmoil at the outset, and O dear Prophet the scheme turned otherwise* for you, so much so that the truth came and the command of Allah appeared, and they disliked it. (* In your favour.)
And among them is one who requests you that, “Grant me exemption (from fighting) and do not put me to test”; pay heed! They have indeed fallen into trial; and indeed hell surrounds the disbelievers.
If good befalls you they dislike it; and were some calamity to befall you, they would say, “We had resolved our matters in advance”, and would turn away rejoicing.
Say, O dear Prophet “Nothing shall befall us except what Allah has destined for us; He is our Master; and the Muslims must rely only on Allah.”
Say, “What do you wait for to happen to us, except one of the two good things?* And for you, we look forward to Allah afflicting you with a punishment from Himself or by our hands; so wait – we too await with you.” (*Death in Allah’s way or victory.)
Say, “Spend willingly or with a heavy heart, it will never be accepted from you; indeed you are a disobedient people.”
And their spending was not stopped being accepted, except because they disbelieved in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and they come to prayer with heavy hearts, and they do not spend except unwillingly.
So let not their riches or their children surprise you; Allah only intends to punish them in the life of this world with these things and that they die only as disbelievers.
And they (the hypocrites) swear by Allah that they are from among you (Muslims); and they are not from among you – however those people are afraid.
If they find some refuge, or caves, or a place to hide, they will break the bonds and return there.
And among them is one who slanders you regarding the distribution of charity; so if they receive some of it they would be happy – and if not, thereupon they get displeased!
How excellent it would be, if they were pleased with what Allah and His Noble Messenger had given them and said, “Allah suffices us; Allah will now give us by His munificence, and (so will) Allah’s Noble Messenger – and towards Allah only are we inclined.”
The obligatory charity* is only for the destitute and the really needy, and those who collect it, and for those in whose hearts the love of Islam needs to be instilled**, and to free slaves, and to debtors, and in Allah's cause***, and to the traveller; this is decreed by Allah; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise. (* This applies only to Zakat. ** The new convert to Islam. *** To the fighter having no provisions for holy war.)
And among them (the hypocrites) are those who trouble* the Herald of the Hidden (the Prophet) and say, “He is only ears**”; say “He is a listener for your good, he believes in Allah and believes in what the Muslims say, and is a mercy for the Muslims among you”; and for those who trouble the Noble Messenger of Allah, is a painful punishment. (*To disrespect / trouble the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is blasphemy. **He believes whatever he is told.)
They swear by Allah in your presence in order to please you; whereas Allah – and His Noble Messenger – had more right that they should have pleased Him if they had faith.
Do they not know that for one who opposes Allah and His Noble Messenger, is the fire of hell, to remain in it forever? This is the greatest humiliation.
The hypocrites fear for a chapter being revealed regarding them, which may disclose what is hidden in their hearts; say, “Keep mocking; Allah will certainly disclose what you fear.”
And if you ask them, they will say, “We were just having fun and pastime”; say, “What! You mock at Allah and His verses and His Noble Messenger?”
“Do not feign excuses, you have turned disbelievers after becoming Muslims”; if We forgive some of you*, We shall punish others because they were guilty. (* One who kept quiet and later repented.)
The hypocrite men and women are all the same; enjoining wrong and forbidding right, and being tight-fisted*; they have forgotten Allah, so Allah has forsaken them; indeed the hypocrites – it is they who are really disobedient. (* Not spending in Allah's cause)
Allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers, the fire of hell in which they will remain forever; that is sufficient for them; and Allah’s curse is upon them; and for them is a never ending punishment.
Like those who were before you – they were mightier than you in strength, and had more wealth and children than you; so they spent their portion – you spent your portion just as those before you spent their portion and you fell into shame (sin) like they had fallen into shame; their deeds have been wasted in the world and in the Hereafter; it is they who are the losers.
Did not the news of those before them reach them – the people of Nooh, and the A’ad, and the Thamud – the people of Ibrahim, the people of Madyan and the dwellings that were overturned? Their Noble Messengers had brought clear proofs to them; so it did not befit Allah’s Majesty to oppress them, but in fact they wronged themselves.
And the Muslim men and Muslim women are the friends of one another; enjoining right and forbidding wrong, and keeping the prayer established and paying the obligatory charity, obeying Allah and His Noble Messenger; these are upon whom Allah will soon have mercy; indeed Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
Allah has promised the Muslim men and Muslim women, Gardens beneath which rivers flow – they will abide in it forever – and pure dwellings in Gardens of everlasting stay; and the greatest (reward) is Allah’s pleasure; this is the supreme success.
O Herald of the Hidden! Fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them; and their destination hell; and what an evil place to return!
And they swear by Allah that they did not say it; whereas indeed they had certainly uttered the words of disbelief, and after having entered Islam turned disbelievers and had wished for what they did not get; and what annoyed them except that Allah, and His Noble Messenger, made them prosperous with His grace? So if they repent, it is better for them; and if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a painful punishment – in this world and the Hereafter; and they will have neither a protector nor any supporter in the entire earth.
And among them are those who made a covenant with Allah that, “If He gives us by His munificence, we will surely give charity and surely become righteous.”
Therefore when Allah gave them by His munificence, they hoarded it and turning their faces, went back.* (* Reneged on their promise).
So following this, Allah put hypocrisy in their hearts until the day when they will meet Him – the result of their breaching the promise made to Allah, and because they lied.
Do they not know that Allah knows their secrets and the schemes they whisper, and that Allah is the All Knowing of all the hidden?
Those who find fault in the Muslims who give the charity wholeheartedly and in those who gain nothing except from their own toil – so they mock at them; Allah will punish them for their mocking; and for them is a painful punishment.
Whether you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) ask forgiveness for them* or not ask forgiveness for them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them; that is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and Allah does not guide the sinful. (* for the hypocrites.)
Those who were left behind rejoiced that behind the Noble Messenger of Allah they had remained seated, and they were unwilling to fight in Allah's cause with their lives or their wealth, and said “Do not venture out in the heat”; say, “The fire of hell is the hottest”; if only they understood!
So they should laugh a little and weep much; the reward of what they used to earn.
Then if Allah takes you back to a group of them and they seek permission from you to go out to fight, say to them, “You shall never go out with me nor ever fight with me against any enemy; you were happy to remain seated for the first time, therefore remain seated with those who stay behind.”
And never offer funeral prayers for any of them* who dies, nor stand by his grave**; indeed they disbelieved in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and they died as sinners. (* It is forbidden to offer funeral prayers for the hypocrites. ** To ask forgiveness for them).
And do not be surprised at their wealth or their children; Allah only wills to torment them with it in this world, and that they pass away upon disbelief.
And when a chapter is sent down that “Accept faith in Allah and fight along with His Noble Messenger”, the men of means among them seek exemption from you and say, “Leave us, for us to be with those who sit.”
They preferred to be with the women who stay behind, and their hearts have been sealed, so they do not understand.
But the Noble Messenger and those who accepted faith with him, fought with their wealth and lives; and for them only are the virtues (rewards); and it is they who have achieved the goal.
Allah has kept ready for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in it forever; this is the greatest success.
And came the ignorant* who make excuses seeking exemption, and those who lied to Allah and His Noble Messenger remained seated; a painful punishment will soon reach the disbelievers among them. (* of faith)
There is no reproach upon the old nor upon the sick nor upon those who do not have the means to spend, provided they remain faithful to Allah and His Noble Messenger; and there is no way of reproach against the virtuous; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Nor against those who humbly present themselves before you in order that you provide them a mount, and receive an answer from you that “I do not have any beast to carry you” – and so they turn back with eyes overflowing with tears, due to the sorrow that they could not find the means to spend.
The way (of reproach) is only against those who seek exemption from you although they are rich; they preferred to be with the women who stay behind – and Allah has sealed their hearts, so they do not know anything.
They will make excuses to you when you return to them; say, “Do not make excuses – we shall never believe you – Allah has given us your tidings; and Allah and His Noble Messenger will now see your deeds, and then you will return to Him Who knows everything, the hidden and the visible – He will inform you of all what you used to do.”
They will now swear by Allah before you, when you return to them, in order that you do not pay attention to them; so do not bother about them; they are indeed filthy; and their destination is hell; the reward of what they used to earn.
They swear before you that you may be pleased with them; so if you become pleased with them, then indeed Allah will never be pleased with the sinful.
The ignorant are more severe in disbelief and hypocrisy, and deserve to remain ignorant of the commands which Allah has revealed to His Noble Messenger; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And some of the ignorant are those who when spending in Allah's cause consider it a ransom, and await the coming of the cycles (of misfortunes) upon you; upon them only is the evil cycle of misfortune; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
And some villagers are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and consider the spending as the means of obtaining proximity to Allah and obtaining the prayers of the Noble Messenger; pay heed! Yes indeed it is the means of proximity for them; Allah will soon admit them into His mercy; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And leading everyone, the first are the Muhajirs* and the Ansar**, and those who followed them with virtue – Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has kept ready for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in it for ever and ever; this is the greatest success. (* The immigrants. **Those who helped the immigrants.)
And some of the illiterates around you are hypocrites; and some of the people of Medinah; hypocrisy has become ingrained in them; you do not know them*; We know them; We shall soon punish them twice** – they will then be consigned towards the terrible punishment.*** (*Until now or as well as We do. ** In life and in the grave *** of hell.)
And there are others who have acknowledged their sins and mixed a good deed with another that was bad; it is likely that Allah will accept their repentance; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) take the obligatory charity from their wealth, by which you may cleanse them and make them pure, and pray in their favour; indeed your prayer is the contentment of their hearts; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Do they not know that Allah only accepts repentance of His bondmen and He takes the charity* and that Allah only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful? (* into His control.)
And say “Keep on with your works – Allah will now see your deeds, and so will His Noble Messenger and the Muslims; and soon you will return to the One Who knows everything – the hidden and the visible – so He will inform you of what you used to do.”
And some are kept waiting for Allah’s command – He may punish them or accept their repentance; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And those (hypocrites) who built a mosque to cause harm, and due to disbelief, and in order to cause divisions among the Muslims, and to await the one who is at the outset an opponent of Allah and His Noble Messenger; and they will surely swear that “We wished only good”; and Allah is witness that they are indeed liars.
Never stand (for worship) in that mosque*; indeed the mosque** that has been founded on piety from the very first day deserves that you should stand in it; in it are the people who wish to thoroughly cleanse themselves; and Allah loves the clean. (*The mosque built by the hypocrites. ** The mosque at Quba, built by the Holy Prophet and his companions. The merit of praying 2 Raka’ Nawafil in it is equal to the reward of an Umrah.)
So is one who established his foundation upon the fear of Allah and upon His pleasure better, or the one who laid his foundation upon the brink of a falling precipice, so it fell along with him into the fire of hell? And Allah does not guide the unjust.
The building which they erected will constantly keep disturbing their hearts unless their hearts are torn to pieces; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
Indeed Allah has purchased from the Muslims their lives and their wealth in exchange of Paradise for them; fighting in Allah's cause, slaying and being slain; a true promise incumbent upon His mercy, (mentioned) in the Taurat and the Injeel and the Qur’an; who fulfils His promise better than Allah? Therefore rejoice upon your deal that you have made with Him; and this is the great success.
Those who repent, those who worship, those who praise, those who fast, those who bow, those who prostrate, those who show right and forbid wrong and those who keep the limits of Allah in sight; and give glad tidings to the Muslims.
It does not befit the Prophet and those who believe, to pray for the forgiveness of polytheists even if they may be their relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are the people of hell.
And the seeking of forgiveness for his father (paternal uncle) by Ibrahim was only because of a promise he had made to him; then when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, Ibrahim broke off ties with him; indeed Ibrahim is surely very soft-hearted, most forbearing.
And it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to send a nation astray after He has guided them until He has made clear to them what they should avoid; indeed Allah knows everything.
Indeed for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and He gives death; and other than Allah, you have neither a Protector nor any Supporter.
Indeed Allah’s mercy inclined towards the Herald of the Hidden, and the Muhajirs and the Ansar who stood by him in the time of hardship, after it was likely that the hearts of a group among them would turn away – He then inclined towards them with mercy; indeed He is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful upon them.
And also upon the three who were kept in waiting; when the earth, vast as it is, was restricted for them, and they became weary of their own lives and became certain that there is no refuge from Allah except with Him; He then accepted their repentance in order that they remain repentant; indeed Allah is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah, and be with the truthful.
It did not befit the people of Medinah and the people of the villages around them, to stay behind the Noble Messenger of Allah, nor to consider their own lives dearer than his life; that is because the thirst or the pain or the hunger that afflicts them in Allah's cause, and the step they tread on a place that angers the disbelievers, and whatever harm they cause the enemy – a good deed is recorded for them in lieu of all of these; indeed Allah does not waste the wages of the virtuous.
And whatever they spend, small or great, or any valley they cross – it is all recorded for them, so that Allah may reward them for their best deeds.
And it is not possible for the Muslims that all of them go out; so it should be that a party from each group goes forth in order to gain knowledge in religion, and upon returning they warn their people in the hope that they may avoid.
O People who Believe – fight the disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find severity in you, and know well that Allah is with the pious.
And whenever a chapter is sent down, some of them say, “Whose faith among you has this promoted?” So it has promoted the faith of the believers and they are rejoicing!
And for those in whose hearts is a disease, it has added filth to their filth, and they died as disbelievers.
Do they not observe that they are tested once or twice every year? Yet they do not repent, nor do they heed advice!
And whenever a chapter is sent down, one of them looks at the other; “Is there someone watching you?” – and then they turn away; Allah has inverted their hearts because they are a people who do not understand.
Indeed there has come to you a Noble Messenger from among you – your falling into hardship aggrieves him, most concerned for your well being, for the Muslims most compassionate, most merciful.
Then if they turn away, say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Allah suffices me; there is no worship except for Him; only Him have I trusted, and He is the Lord Of The Great Throne.”
