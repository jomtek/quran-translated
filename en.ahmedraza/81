When the sunlight is rolled up.
And when the stars fall down.
And when the mountains are driven.
And when milch camels roam abandoned.
And when wild animals are herded together.
And when the seas are set afire.
And when the souls are paired.
And when the girl-child who was buried alive is asked.
Upon what sin was she killed for.
And when the Records of Account are laid bare.
And when the heaven is torn away.
And when hell is further enflamed.
And when Paradise is brought near.
Every soul will then come know what it has brought.
So by oath of those that revolve. (The planets.)
Who move straight and stop.
And by oath of the night when it turns back.
And by oath of the morning when it takes birth.
This is indeed the recitation of an honoured Noble Messenger. (Angel Jibreel – peace and blessings be upon him.)
The mighty, the honoured in the presence of the Lord of the Throne.
The one who is obeyed, and trustworthy. (Other angels obey angel Jibreel).
And your companion is not insane.
And indeed he saw him on the clear horizon. (Prophet Mohammed saw Angel Jibreel in his true shape – peace and blessings be upon them).
And this Prophet is not miserly upon the hidden. (Allah gave the knowledge of the hidden to the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
And the Qur’an is not the recitation of Satan the outcast.
So where are you going?
That is but an advice to the entire creation!
For the one among you who wishes to become upright.
And what will you wish, except if Allah wills – the Lord of the Creation.
