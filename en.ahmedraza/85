By oath of the heaven which contains the constellations.
And by oath of the Promised Day.
And by oath of the day that is a witness and by oath of a day in which the people present themselves.
Accursed be the People of the Ditch!
The people of the fuelled blazing fire.
When they were sitting at its edge.
And they themselves are witnesses to what they were doing to the Muslims!
And what did they dislike from the Muslims, except that the Muslims accepted faith in Allah the Most Honourable, the Most Praiseworthy?
To Him only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is a Witness over all things.
Indeed those who troubled the Muslim men and Muslim women, and then did not repent – for them is the punishment of hell, and for them is the punishment of fire.
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; this is the great success.
Indeed the seizure of your Lord is very severe.
Indeed it is He Who initiates and redoes.
And He only is the Oft Forgiving, the Beloved of His bondmen.
Master of the Honourable Throne.
Always doing whatever He wills.
Did the story of the armies reach you?
(The armies of) Firaun and the tribe of Thamud.
In fact the disbelievers are in denial.
And Allah is after them, has them surrounded.
In fact it (what they deny) is the Noble Qur’an.
In the Preserved Tablet.
