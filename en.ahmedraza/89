By oath of the (particular) dawn.
And by oath of ten nights.
And by oath of the even and the odd.
And by oath of the night when it recedes
Why is there an oath in this, for the intelligent?
Did you not see how did your Lord deal with (the tribe of) Aad?
(And) the tall giants of Iram?
Like whom no one else was born in the cities.
And the tribe of Thamud, who hewed rocks in the valley.
And with Firaun, who used to crucify.
Those who rebelled in the cities,
And who then spread a lot of turmoil in them.
Therefore your Lord struck them hard with the means of punishment.
Indeed nothing is hidden from the sight of your Lord.
So man, whenever his Lord tests him by giving him honour and favours – thereupon he says, “My Lord has honoured me.”
And if He tests him and restricts his livelihood – thereupon he says, “My Lord has degraded me!”
Not at all – but rather you do not honour the orphan.
And do not urge one another to feed the needy.
And you readily devour the inheritance with greed.
And you harbour intense love for wealth.
Most certainly – when the earth is smashed and blown to bits.
And when the command of your Lord comes – and the angels row by row,
And when hell is brought that day – on that day will man reflect, but where is the time now to think?
He will say, “Alas – if only I had sent some good deeds ahead, during my lifetime!”
So on that day, no one punishes like He does!
And no one binds like He does!
O the contented soul!
Return towards your Lord – you being pleased with Him, and He pleased with you!
Then enter the ranks of My chosen bondmen!
And come into My Paradise!
