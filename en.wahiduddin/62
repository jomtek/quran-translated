Whatever is in the heavens and on the earth glorifies God, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the Mighty, the Wise.
It is He who has raised among the unlettered people a messenger from among themselves who recites His revelations to them, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, for they had formerly been clearly misguided --
and to others also, from among them, who have not yet joined them. He is the Mighty, the Wise One.
That is God's grace; He bestows it on whom He pleases; for God is limitless in His grace.
Those who were charged with bearing the Torah, but did not do so are like an ass carrying a load of books. How unfortunate are those who belie the sign of God. God does not guide the wrongdoers.
Say, "You who are Jews, if you claim that you are favoured by God out of all people, then long for death, if you are truthful."
They will never wish for it, because of what their hands have sent forward. God has full knowledge of evil-doers.
So say, "The death you run away from will certainly meet you, and thereafter you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will declare to you what you have done."
Believers! When the call to prayer is made on the day of congregation, hasten to the remembrance of God, and leave all worldly commerce: this is for your own good, if you but knew it.
When the prayer is ended, disperse in the land and seek to obtain [something] of God's bounty; and remember God much, so that you may prosper.
Yet when they see some merchandise or entertainment, they break away to go to it and leave you standing. Say, "That which God has in store is far better than any merchandise or entertainment." God is the most munificent Giver.
