Read! In the name of your Lord, who created:
created man from a clot [of blood].
Read! Your Lord is the Most Bountiful One
who taught by the pen,
taught man what he did not know.
Yet man behaves arrogantly,
because he thinks himself self-sufficient:
truly, all will return to your Lord.
Have you seen one who prevents
a worshipper from praying?
Do you think he is rightly guided,
or enjoins true piety?
Do you see how he has denied the truth and turned away from it?
Does he not know that God observes all things?
Let him beware! If he does not desist, We will drag him by the forelock --
his lying, sinful forelock.
Then let him call his associates;
We shall summon the guards of Hell.
No indeed! Do not obey him, but prostrate yourself and come closer to God.
