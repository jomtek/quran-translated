By the snorting, panting horses,
striking sparks of fire with their hooves,
as they gallop to make raids at dawn,
and raising clouds of dust,
forcing their way into the midst of the enemy,
surely, man is ungrateful to his Lord.
He himself bears witness to that.
Surely, he is ardent in his love of wealth.
Is he not aware of the time when the contents of the graves will be brought out?
And the hearts' contents shall be brought into the open?
Surely, on that Day, they will know that their Lord had full knowledge of them all.
