Have you heard about the Overwhelming Event?
On that Day, there shall be downcast faces,
labouring, weary,
they shall enter a burning Fire
and will be made to drink from a boiling spring,
they shall have no food but thorns,
which will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger.
Some faces on that Day will be radiant,
well pleased with the result of their striving,
in a sublime garden,
where they will hear no idle talk,
with a flowing spring,
raised couches,
and goblets set at hand,
cushions ranged,
and carpets spread out.
Do they never reflect on the camels and how they were created,
and on the sky, how it is raised aloft,
and on the mountains, how they are firmly set up,
and on the earth, how it is spread out?
So, [O Prophet] exhort them: your task is only to exhort,
you are not their keeper.
But whoever turns back and denies the truth,
will be punished by God with the greatest punishment.
Certainly, it is to Us that they will return.
Then, surely, it is for Us to call them to account.
