By the night as it veils [the earth] in darkness,
and by the day as it appears radiantly,
and by the creation of the male and the female.
O men, you truly strive towards the most diverse ends!
As for one who gives [to others] and fears [God],
and believes in the truth of what is right,
We will pave his way to ease.
But as for one who is miserly and unheeding,
and rejects what is right,
We shall pave his way to hardship,
nor will his wealth profit him when he falls [into the pit].
Surely, it is for Us to provide guidance --
and to Us belongs the Hereafter as well as the present world --
I have warned you then about a raging Fire:
none shall enter it but the most wicked,
who denied [the truth], and turned away.
One who fears God shall be kept away from it --
one who gives his wealth to become purified,
and owes no favour to anyone, which is to be repaid,
acting only for the sake of his Lord the Most High --
and before long he will be well satisfied.
