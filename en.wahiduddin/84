When the sky bursts open,
and obeys its Lord as it must,
when the earth flattens out,
and casts out all that is within it and becomes empty;
and obeys its Lord as it must,
O man, having striven hard towards your Lord, you shall meet Him:
he who is given his record in his right hand
shall have an easy reckoning
and he shall return to his people, joyfully,
but as for him whose record shall be given to him from behind his back,
he will pray for utter destruction
and he will enter the blazing flame.
He used to be happy with his own people;
for he never thought that he would have to return [to God].
But he will indeed! His Lord was ever watching him.
I swear by the glow of sunset,
by the night and what it covers,
and the moon when it grows full,
you will progress from stage to stage.
What is wrong with them that they do not believe?
When the Quran is read to them, why do they not fall to their knees?
Indeed, those who are bent on denying the truth reject it --
God is quite aware of what they are storing in their hearts.
Therefore, give them the news of a painful punishment.
But for those who believe and do good works; for them there shall be a never-ending reward.
