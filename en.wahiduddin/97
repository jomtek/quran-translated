We sent it [Quran] down on the Night of Destiny.
And what will make you comprehend what the Night of Destiny is?
The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months;
on that night, the angels and the Spirit come down by the permission of their Lord with His decrees for all matters;
it is all peace till the break of dawn.
