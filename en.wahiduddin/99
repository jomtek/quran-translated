When the earth is shaken with its violent shaking,
when the earth shakes off her burdens,
when man asks, "What is happening to her?";
on that Day it will narrate its account,
for your Lord has so directed it.
On that Day people will come forward in separate groups to be shown their deeds:
whoever has done the smallest particle of good will see it;
while whoever has done the smallest particle of evil will see it.
