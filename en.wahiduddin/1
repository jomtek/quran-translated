In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
All praise is due to God, the Lord of the Universe;
the Beneficent, the Merciful;
Lord of the Day of Judgement.
You alone we worship, and to You alone we turn for help.
Guide us to the straight path:
the path of those You have blessed; not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.
