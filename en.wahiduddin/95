By the Fig and the Olive,
and by Mount Sinai,
and by this secure land,
We have indeed created man in the best of mould,
then We cast him down as the lowest of the low,
except for those who believe and do good deeds -- theirs shall be an unending reward!
What then after this, can make you deny the Last Judgement?
Is not God the greatest of the judges?
