By the sky with its constellations,
and by the promised Day,
by the Witness and the witnessed,
destroyed were the people of the trench,
the makers of the fuel-stoked fire!
They sat by it
to watch what they were doing to the believers,
whom they hated for no other reason than that they believed in God, the Almighty, the Praiseworthy,
to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God is witness over all things.
Those who persecute the believing men and believing women, and then do not repent, will surely suffer the punishment of Hell, and the torment of burning.
But those who believe and do good deeds shall be rewarded with gardens watered by flowing rivers. That is the supreme triumph.
The grip of your Lord is indeed severe,
it is He who begins and repeats [His creation],
and He is the Forgiving and Loving One.
The Lord of the Glorious Throne,
Executor of His own will.
Have you not heard the story of the hosts
of Pharaoh and Thamud?
Yet those who deny the truth persist in denial.
God encompasses them from all sides.
It is indeed a glorious Quran,
written on a preserved Tablet.
