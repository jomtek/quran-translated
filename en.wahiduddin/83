Woe to those who give short measure,
who demand of other people full measure for themselves,
but when they give by measurement or weight to others, they give them less.
Do such people not realize that they will be raised up,
on a fateful Day.
The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe?
Indeed! The record of the wicked is in the Sijjin --
and what could make you understand what the Sijjin is? --
it is a written record.
Woe, on that Day, to those who reject,
those who deny the Day of Judgement.
No one denies it except for the evil aggressor.
When Our revelations are conveyed to him, he says, "Fables of the ancients!"
No! Their own deeds have cast a veil over their hearts.
Indeed! On that Day a barrier will be set between them and their Lord,
then they shall enter the Fire of Hell,
and they will be told, "This is what you were wont to belie."
But, the record of the righteous is [preserved] in the 'Illiyyin --
and what will make you understand what the 'Illiyyin is? --
a written record,
which those angels closest to God will bear witness to.
The virtuous will surely be in bliss,
seated on couches and gazing around in wonder.
You will find in their faces the brightness of bliss.
They will be given a drink of pure wine, sealed,
its seal will be of musk -- for this let the aspirants aspire --
a wine tempered with the waters of Tasnim,
a spring at which those drawn close to God will drink.
The wicked used to laugh at the believers --
when they passed by them, they would wink at one another;
and when they returned to their own people, they would speak of them jestingly;
and when they saw them, they said [scornfully], "These men have surely gone astray,"
though they were not sent to be their keepers --
so today those who believe shall [be able to] laugh at those who denied the truth
as they sit on couches, gazing around.
Have those who deny the truth [not] been paid back for their deeds?
