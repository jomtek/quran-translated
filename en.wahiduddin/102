Greed for more and more distracted you [from God]
till you reached the grave.
But you will soon come to know.
But you will soon come to know.
Indeed, were you to know the truth with certainty,
you would see the fire of Hell.
You would see it with the eye of certainty.
Then on that Day you shall be questioned about your worldly favours.
