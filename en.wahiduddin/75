By the Day of Resurrection,
and by the self-reproaching soul!
Does man think that We cannot [resurrect him and] bring his bones together again?
Indeed, We have the power to restore his very finger tips!
Yet man wants to deny what is ahead of him:
he asks, "When is this Day of Resurrection to be?"
But [on that Day], when mortal sight is confounded,
and the moon is eclipsed,
when the sun and the moon are brought together,
on that Day man will ask, "Where can I escape?"
But there is nowhere to take refuge:
on that Day, to your Lord alone is the recourse.
On that Day, man will be told of all that he has sent before and what he has left behind.
Indeed, man shall be a witness against himself,
in spite of all the excuses he may offer.
[Prophet], do not move your tongue too fast in your attempt to learn this revelation:
We Ourself shall see to its collection and recital.
When We have recited it, follow its words attentively;
and then, it will be for Us to make its meaning clear.
Truly, you love immediate gain
and neglect the Hereafter.
Some faces will be radiant on that Day,
looking towards their Lord;
and some faces will on that Day be gloomy,
dreading some great affliction.
But when [man's soul] reaches the throat,
and when it is asked: "Could any magician save him now?";
and he knows that it is the time of parting;
when his legs are brought together [when affliction is combined with affliction];
on that Day he will be driven towards your Lord!
He neither believed nor prayed,
but rejected the Truth and turned away!
Then he went off to his people, swaggering.
Woe to you, [O man!], yes, woe to you.
Again, woe to you, [O man!], yes, woe to you!
Does man, then, think that he is to be left to himself, to go about at will?
Was he not once a drop of ejaculated semen,
which then became a leech-like clot; then God shaped and fashioned him in due proportion,
fashioning out of him the two sexes, the male and the female?
Then is He not able to bring the dead back to life?
