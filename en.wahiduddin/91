By the sun and its rising brightness
and by the moon as it follows it,
and by the day as it reveals its glory
and by the night when it draws a veil over it,
by the sky and how He built it
and by the earth and how He spread it,
by the soul and how He formed it,
then inspired it to understand what was right and wrong for it.
He who purifies it will indeed be successful,
and he who corrupts it is sure to fail.
The Thamud tribe rejected the truth because of their arrogance,
when the most wicked man among them rose up.
Then the messenger of God said to them, "This is God's she-camel. Let her drink."
But they gave him the lie, and hamstrung the she-camel. So their Lord destroyed them for their crime and razed their city to the ground.
He did not fear the consequences.
