When the sky is cleft asunder;
and when the stars are scattered;
when the seas overflow;
and when the graves are laid open:
then everyone will know what he has sent ahead, and what he has left behind.
O man! What is it that lures you away from your bountiful Sustainer,
who created you, fashioned you and proportioned you,
in whatever form He pleased?
Yet you deny the Last Judgement.
Surely, there are guardians watching over you,
noble recorders,
who know all that you do:
the virtuous will dwell in bliss,
whereas the wicked will be in Hell;
which they shall enter on the Day of Judgement,
and from which they will find no escape.
What will make you realize what the Day of Judgement will be?
Again: what will make you realize what the Day of Judgement will be?
It will be a Day when no human being shall be of the least avail to any other human being, God [alone] will hold command on that Day.
