Woe to every fault-finding back-biter,
who amasses wealth, counting it over,
thinking that his wealth will make him live forever.
By no means! He shall surely be cast into the crushing torment.
Would that you understood what that crushing torment is like.
It is a Fire kindled by God.
Reaching right into the hearts of men,
it closes in on them from every side
in towering columns.
