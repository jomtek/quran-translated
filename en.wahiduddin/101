The Clatterer!
What is the Clatterer?
Would that you knew what the Clatterer is!
[It is] a Day when mankind shall be like scattered moths
and the mount-ains like tufts of carded wool.
Then, the one whose good deeds weigh heavy on the scales,
will have a most pleasing life.
But as for him whose deeds are light on the scales,
the Abyss shall be his home.
What will convey to you what this is like?
It is a blazing fire.
