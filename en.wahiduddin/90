I swear by this city --
and you are dwelling in this city --
and by parent and offspring,
that We have created man into a life of toil and trial.
Does he think then that no one has power over him?
He says, "I have spent enormous wealth."
Does he then think that no one sees him?
Have We not given him two eyes,
and a tongue, and a pair of lips,
and shown him the two paths?
But he has not attempted the ascent.
What will explain to you what the ascent is?
It is the freeing of a slave;
or the feeding in times of famine
of an orphaned relative
or some needy person in distress,
and to be one of those who believe and urge one another to steadfastness and compassion.
Those who do so are the people of the right hand,
and [as for] those who are bent on denying the truth of Our revelations, they are the people of the left hand,
and the Fire will close in on them.
