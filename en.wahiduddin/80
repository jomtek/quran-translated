He frowned and turned away
when the blind man approached him,
for how can you know that he might seek to purify himself,
or take heed and derive benefit from [Our] warning?
As for him who was indifferent,
you eagerly attended to him --
though you are not to be blamed if he would not purify himself --
but as for one who comes to you, eagerly
and in awe of God
you pay him no heed.
Indeed, this [Quran] is an admonition.
Let him who will, pay heed to it.
It is set down on honoured pages,
exalted and purified,
by the hands of
noble and virtuous scribes.
Woe to man! How ungrateful he is!
Of what [stuff] has He created him?
Out of a drop of sperm! He creates and proportions him,
He makes his path easy for him.
Then He causes him to die and be buried.
Then when He pleases, He will bring him back to life.
Yet man declines to do His bidding.
Let man reflect on the food he eats.
We let the rain pour down in torrents
and then We cleaved the earth asunder.
We make the grain grow out of it,
and grape vines and vegetables,
and olive trees and date palms
and burgeoning enclosed gardens
and fruits and fodder
as provision for you and for your cattle to enjoy.
But when the deafening blast is sounded,
on that Day a man shall flee from his own brother,
his mother, his father,
his wife and his sons:
on that Day every man among them will have enough concern of his own --
on that Day some faces will be beaming,
laughing, and rejoicing,
but some faces will be covered with dust
and overcast with gloom:
those will be ones who denied the truth and were immersed in iniquity.
