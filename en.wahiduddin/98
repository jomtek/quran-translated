The deniers of truth from among the People of the Book and the polytheists would not desist from disbelief until they received clear evidence --
a messenger from God, reciting to them pure scriptures,
containing upright precepts.
Those who were given the Book did not become divided except after clear evidence was given to them.
They were commanded only to worship God, offering Him sincere devotion, to be sincere in their faith, to pray regularly; and to give alms, for that is the right religion.
Those of the deniers of truth among the People of the Book and the polytheists will dwell forever in Hell-fire. They are the worst of creatures.
Truly, those who believe and do good works are the best of creatures.
God has a reward in store for them: Gardens of eternity, through which rivers flow; they will dwell therein forever. God is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. Thus shall the God-fearing be rewarded.
