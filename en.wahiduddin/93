By the glorious morning light;
and by the night when it darkens,
your Lord has not forsaken you, nor is He displeased with you,
and the Hereafter will indeed be better for you than the present life;
soon you will be gratified with what your Lord will give you.
Did He not find you orphaned and shelter you?
Did He not find you wandering, and give you guidance?
Did He not find you in want, and make you free from want?
Therefore do not treat the orphan with harshness,
and do not chide the one who asks for help;
but proclaim the blessings of your Lord.
