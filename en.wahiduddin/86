By the heavens and that which comes in the night --
and what could make you know what it is that comes in the night?
It is the shining star --
[for] no human being has been left unguarded.
Let man reflect on what he was created from.
He was created from spurting fluid,
issuing from between the backbone and the breastbone:
He certainly has the power to bring him back to life.
On the Day when secrets are disclosed,
[man] will have no power, and no helper.
By the heavens, ever-revolving,
by the earth cracking open with new growth.
It is surely a decisive utterance;
and is not to be taken lightly.
They are planning a scheme,
and so am I:
so bear with those who deny the truth, and let them be for a little while.
