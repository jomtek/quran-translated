Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,
who created all things and gave them due proportions,
who determines the nature [of all that exists], and guided it accordingly;
who brings forth green pasture,
then turns it into black stubble.
[O Prophet!] We shall make you recite the Quran so that you will not forget any of it --
except whatever God wills; He knows both what is manifest and what is hidden --
We shall facilitate for you the Easy Way.
Remind, if the reminder can be of benefit.
He who fears [God] will heed the reminder,
but it will be ignored by the most unfortunate,
who will enter the Great Fire,
where he will neither die nor live.
He who purifies himself,
who remembers the name of his Lord and prays, shall indeed be successful.
But you prefer the life of this world,
although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
This indeed is what is taught in the former scriptures --
the scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
