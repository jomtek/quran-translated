The faithless from among the People of the Book and the polytheists were not set apart [from the community of the faithful] until the proof had come to them:
an apostle from Allah reciting impeccable scriptures,
wherein are upright writings.
Those who were given the Book did not divide except after the proof had come to them.
Though they were not commanded except to worship Allah, dedicating their faith to Him as men of pure faith, and to maintain the prayer and pay the zakat. That is the upright religion.
Indeed the faithless from among the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the fire of hell, to remain in it [forever]. It is they who are the worst of creatures.
Indeed those who have faith and do righteous deedsâ€”it is they who are the best of creatures.
Their reward, near their Lord, is the Gardens of Eden, with streams running in them, to remain in them forever. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. That is for those who fear their Lord.
