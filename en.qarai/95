By the fig and the olive,
by Mount Sinai,
and by this secure town:
We certainly created man in the best of forms;
then We relegated him to the lowest of the low,
except those who have faith and do righteous deeds. There will be an everlasting reward for them.
So what makes you deny the Retribution?
Is not Allah the fairest of all judges?
