Did you receive the account of the Enveloper?
Some faces on that day will be humbled,
wrought-up and weary:
they will enter a scorching fire
and made to drink from a boiling spring.
They will have no food except cactus,
neither nourishing, nor of avail against hunger.
Some faces on that day will be joyous,
pleased with their endeavour,
in a lofty garden,
where they will not hear any vain talk.
In it is a flowing spring
and raised couches,
with goblets set,
and cushions laid out in an array,
and carpets spread out.
Do they not observe the camel, [to see] how it has been created?
and the sky, how it has been raised?
and the mountains, how they have been set?
and the earth, how it has been surfaced?
So admonish—for you are only an admonisher,
and not a taskmaster over them—
except him who turns back and disbelieves.
Him Allah will punish with the greatest punishment.
Indeed to Us will be their return.
Then, indeed, their reckoning will lie with Us.
