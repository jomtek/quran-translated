When the sky is split open
and gives ear to its Lord as it should.
When the earth is spread out
and throws out what is in it, emptying itself,
and gives ear to its Lord as it should.
O man! You are labouring toward your Lord laboriously, and you will encounter Him.
Then, as for him who is given his record [of deeds] in his right hand,
he will receive an easy reckoning,
and he will return to his folks joyfully.
But as for him who is given his record from behind his back,
he will pray for annihilation
and enter the Blaze.
Indeed he used to be joyful among his folk,
and he thought that he would never return.
Yes, his Lord had been watching him.
I swear by the evening glow,
by the night and what it is fraught with,
by the moon when it blooms full:
you will surely fare from stage to stage.
What is the matter with them that they will not believe,
and will not prostrate when the Quran is recited to them?
Indeed, the faithless impugn [the Apostle],
and Allah knows best what they keep to themselves.
So inform them of a painful punishment,
excepting such as are faithful and do righteous deeds: for them there will be an everlasting reward.
