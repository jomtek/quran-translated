By the Mount [Sinai],
by the Book inscribed
on an unrolled parchment;
by the House greatly frequented;
by the vault raised high,
by the surging sea:
indeed your Lord’s punishment will surely befall.
There is none who can avert it.
On the day when the sky whirls violently,
and the mountains move with an awful motion:
woe to the deniers on that day
—those who play around in vain talk,
the day when they will be shoved forcibly toward the fire of hell, [and told:]
‘This is the Fire which you used to deny!
Is this, then, [also] magic, or is it you who do not perceive?
Enter it, and it will be the same for you whether you are patient or impatient. You are only being requited for what you used to do.’
Indeed the Godwary will be amid gardens and bliss,
rejoicing because of what their Lord has given them, and that their Lord has saved them from the punishment of hell.
[They will be told:] ‘Enjoy your food and drink, [as a reward] for what you used to do.’
They will be reclining on arrayed couches, and We will wed them to big-eyed houris.
The faithful and their descendants who followed them in faith—We will make their descendants join them, and We will not stint anything from [the reward of] their deeds. Every person is hostage to what he has earned.
We will provide them with fruits and meat, such as they desire.
There they will pass from hand to hand a cup wherein there will be neither any vain talk nor sinful speech.
They will be waited upon by their youths, as if they were guarded pearls.
They will turn to one another, questioning each other.
They will say, ‘Indeed, aforetime, we used to be apprehensive about our families.
But Allah showed us favour and He saved us from the punishment of the [infernal] miasma.
We used to supplicate Him aforetime. Indeed He is the All-benign, the All-merciful.’
So admonish. By your Lord’s blessing, you are not a soothsayer, nor mad.
Do they say, ‘[He is] a poet, for whom we await a fatal accident’?
Say, ‘Wait! I too am waiting along with you.’
Is it their intellect which prompts them to [say] this, or are they a rebellious lot?
Do they say, ‘He has improvised it [himself]?’ Rather, they have no faith!
Let them bring a discourse like it, if they are truthful.
Were they created from nothing? Or are they [their own] creators?
Did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they have no certainty!
Do they possess the treasuries of your Lord? Or do they control [them]?
Do they have a ladder [leading up to heaven] whereby they eavesdrop? If so, let their eavesdropper produce a manifest authority.
Does He have daughters while you have sons?
Do you ask them for a reward, so that they are [wary of] being weighed down with debt?
Do they have [access to] the Unseen, which they write down?
Do they seek to outmaneuver [Allah]? But it is the faithless who are the outmaneuvered ones!
Do they have any god other than Allah? Clear is Allah of any partners that they may ascribe [to Him]!
Were they to see a fragment falling from the sky, they would say, ‘A cumulous cloud.’
So leave them until they encounter the day when they will be thunderstruck,
the day when their guile will not avail them in any way, nor will they be helped.
Indeed there is a punishment besides that for those who do wrong, but most of them do not know.
So submit patiently to the judgement of your Lord, for indeed you fare before Our eyes. And celebrate the praise of your Lord when you rise [at dawn],
and also glorify Him during the night and at the receding of the stars.
