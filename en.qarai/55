The All-beneficent
has taught the Quran.
He created man,
[and] taught him articulate speech.
The sun and the moon are [disposed] calculatedly,
and the herb and the tree prostrate [to Allah].
He raised the heaven high and set up the balance,
declaring, ‘Do not infringe the balance!
Maintain the weights with justice, and do not shorten the balance!’
And the earth—He laid it out for mankind.
In it are fruits and date-palms with sheaths,
grain with husk, and fragrant herbs.
