By the Dawn,
by the ten nights,
by the Even and the Odd,
by the night when it departs!
Is there an oath in that for one possessing intellect?
Have you not regarded how your Lord dealt with [the people of] ‘Ad,
[and] Iram, [the city] of the pillars,
the like of which was not created among cities,
and [the people of] Thamud, who hollowed out the rocks in the valley,
and Pharaoh, the impaler
—those who rebelled [against Allah] in their cities
and caused much corruption in them,
so your Lord poured on them lashes of punishment.
Indeed your Lord is in ambush.
As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, and grants him honour, and blesses him, he says, ‘My Lord has honoured me.’
But when He tests him and tightens for him his provision, he says, ‘My Lord has humiliated me.’
No indeed! No, you do not honour the orphan,
and do not urge the feeding of the needy.
You eat the inheritance rapaciously,
and love wealth with much fondness.
No indeed! When the earth is levelled to a plain,
and your Lord [’s edict] arrives with the angels in ranks,
the day when hell is brought [near], man will take admonition on that day, but what will that admonition avail him?
He will say, ‘Alas, had I sent ahead for my life [in the Hereafter]!’
On that day none shall punish as He punishes,
and none shall bind as He binds.
‘O soul at peace!
Return to your Lord, pleased and pleasing!
Then enter among My servants,
and enter My paradise!’
