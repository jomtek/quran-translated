By the heaven with its Houses,
by the Promised Day,
by the Witness and the Witnessed:
perish the People of the Ditch!
The fire abounding in fuel,
above which they sat
as they were themselves witnesses to what they did to the faithful.
They were vindictive towards them only because they had faith in Allah, the All-mighty and the All-laudable,
to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is witness to all things.
Indeed those who persecute the faithful, men and women, and do not repent thereafter, there is the punishment of hell for them and the punishment of burning.
Indeed those who have faith and do righteous deeds—for them will be gardens with streams running in them. That is the supreme success.
Indeed your Lord’s striking is severe.
It is indeed He who originates and brings back,
and He is the All-forgiving, the All-affectionate,
Lord of the Throne, the All-glorious,
doer of what He desires.
Did you receive the story of the hosts
of Pharaoh and Thamud?
Indeed the faithless dwell in denial,
and Allah besieges them from all around.
Indeed it is a glorious Quran,
in a preserved tablet.
