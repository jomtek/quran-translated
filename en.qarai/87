Celebrate the Name of your Lord, the Most Exalted,
who created and proportioned,
who determined and guided,
who brought forth the pasture
and then turned it into a black scum.
We shall have you recite [the Quran], then you will not forget [any of it]
except what Allah may wish. Indeed, He knows the open and what is hidden.
And We shall ease you into facility.
So admonish, for admonition is indeed beneficial:
he who fears [God] will take admonition,
and the most wretched will shun it
—he who will enter the Great Fire,
then he will neither live in it, nor die.
‘Felicitous is he who purifies himself,
celebrates the Name of his Lord, and prays.
But you prefer the life of this world,
while the Hereafter is better and more lasting.’
This is indeed in the former scriptures,
the scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
