When the sun is wound up,
when the stars scatter,
when the mountains are set moving,
when the pregnant camels are neglected,
when the wild beasts are mustered,
when the seas are set afire,
when the souls are assorted,
when the girl buried-alive will be asked
for what sin she was killed.
When the records [of deeds] are unfolded,
when the sky is stripped off,
when hell is set ablaze,
when paradise is brought near,
then a soul shall know what it has readied [for itself].
So I swear by the stars that return,
the comets,
by the night as it approaches,
by the dawn as it breathes:
it is indeed the speech of a noble apostle,
powerful and eminent with the Lord of the Throne,
one who is obeyed and is trustworthy as well.
Your companion is not crazy:
certainly he saw him on the manifest horizon,
and he is not miserly concerning the Unseen.
And it is not the speech of an outcast Satan.
So where are you going?
It is just a reminder for all the nations,
for those of you who wish to walk straight;
but you will not wish unless it is wished by Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.
