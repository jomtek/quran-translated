Rivalry [and vainglory] distracted you
until you visited [even] the graves.
No indeed, soon you will know!
No indeed, soon you will know for yet another time!
Indeed, were you to know with certain knowledge,
you would have surely seen hell [in this very life].
Afterward you will surely see it with the eye of certainty.
Then, on that day, you will surely be questioned concerning the Blessing.
