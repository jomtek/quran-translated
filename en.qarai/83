Woe to the defrauders, who use short measures,
who, when they measure [a commodity bought] from the people, take the full measure,
but diminish when they measure or weigh for them.
Do they not know that they will be resurrected
on a tremendous day,
a day when mankind will stand before the Lord of all the worlds?
Indeed, the record of the vicious is in Sijjeen.
And what will show you what is Sijjeen?
It is a written record.
Woe to the deniers on that day,
who deny the Day of Retribution;
and none denies it except every sinful transgressor.
When Our signs are recited to him, he says, ‘Myths of the ancients!’
No, that is not the case! Rather, their hearts have been sullied by what they have been earning.
Indeed, they will be alienated from their Lord on that day.
Afterward they will enter hell,
then told, ‘This is what you used to deny!’
Indeed, the record of the pious is in Illeeyun.
And what will show you what is Illeeyun?
It is a written record,
witnessed by those brought near [to Allah].
The pious shall be amid bliss,
observing, [as they recline] on couches.
You will perceive in their faces the freshness of bliss.
They will be served with a sealed pure wine,
whose seal is musk—for such let the viers vie—
and whose seasoning is from Tasneem,
a spring where those brought near [to Allah] drink.
Indeed the guilty used to laugh at the faithful,
and when they passed them by they would wink at each other,
and when they returned to their folks they would return amused,
and when they saw them they would say, ‘Indeed those are the astray!’
Though they were not sent to watch over them.
So today the faithful will laugh at the faithless,
observing from their couches:
Have the faithless been requited for what they used to do?
