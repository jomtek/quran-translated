Woe to every scandal-monger and slanderer,
who amasses wealth and counts it over.
He supposes his wealth will make him immortal!
No indeed! He will surely be cast into the Crusher.
And what will show you what is the Crusher?
[It is] the fire of Allah, set ablaze,
which will overspread the hearts.
Indeed it will close in upon them
in outstretched columns.
