By the [angelic] emissaries sent successively,
by those who sweep along like gale,
by those who publish [the Divine messages] far and wide,
by those who separate [the truth from falsehood] distinctly,
by those who inspire [God’s] remembrance,
as exemption or warning:
what you are promised will surely befall.
When the stars are blotted out
and the sky is cleft,
when the mountains are scattered [like dust]
and time is set for the apostles [to bear witness]
—for what day has [all] that been set [to occur]?
For the Day of Judgement!
And what will show you what is the Day of Judgement!?
Woe to the deniers on that day!
Did We not destroy the former generations,
[and] then made the latter ones follow them?
That is how We deal with the guilty.
Woe to the deniers on that day!
Have We not created you from a base fluid,
[and] then lodged it in a secure abode
until a known span [of time]?
Then We determined; and how excellent determiners We are!
Woe to the deniers on that day!
Have We not made the earth a receptacle
for the living and the dead,
and set in it lofty [and] firm mountains, and given you agreeable water to drink?
Woe to the deniers on that day!
[The faithless will be told:] ‘Proceed toward what you used to deny!
Proceed toward the triple-forked shadow,
neither shady nor of any avail against the flames.
Indeed it throws up [giant] sparks like castles,
[bright] like yellow camels.
Woe to the deniers on that day!
This is a day wherein they will not speak,
nor will they be permitted to offer excuses.
Woe to the deniers on that day!
‘This is the Day of Judgement. We have brought you together with the former generations.
If you have any stratagems [left], try them out against Me!’
Woe to the deniers on that day!
Indeed the Godwary will be amid shades and springs
and [enjoying] such fruits as they desire.
[They will be told:] ‘Enjoy your food and drink, [a reward] for what you used to do.
Thus do We reward the virtuous.’
Woe to the deniers on that day!
‘Eat and enjoy a little! You are indeed guilty.’
Woe to the deniers on that day!
When they are told, ‘Bow down [in prayer],’ they do not bow down!
Woe to the deniers on that day!
So what discourse will they believe after this?
