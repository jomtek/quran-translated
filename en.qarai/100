By the snorting chargers,
by the strikers of sparks [with their hoofs],
by the raiders at dawn,
raising therein a trail of dust,
and cleaving therein a host!
Indeed man is ungrateful to his Lord,
and indeed he is [himself] witness to that!
And indeed he is an avid lover of wealth.
Does he not know, when what is [buried] in the graves is turned over,
and what is [concealed] in the breasts is divulged,
on that day their Lord will be well informed about them [and their deeds]?
