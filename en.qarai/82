When the sky is rent apart,
when the stars are scattered,
when the seas are merged,
when the graves are overturned,
then a soul shall know what it has sent ahead and left behind.
O man! What has deceived you about your generous Lord,
who created you and proportioned you, and gave you an upright nature,
and composed you in any form that He wished?
No! Indeed, you deny the Retribution.
Indeed, there are over you watchers,
noble writers,
who know whatever you do.
Indeed the pious shall be amid bliss,
and indeed the vicious shall be in hell,
entering it on the Day of Retribution,
and they shall not be absent from it.
And what will show you what is the Day of Retribution?
Again, what will show you what is the Day of Retribution?
It is a day when no soul will be of any avail to another soul and all command that day will belong to Allah.
