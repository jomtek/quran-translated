When the earth is rocked with a terrible quake
and discharges its burdens,
and man says, ‘What is the matter with her?’
On that day she will relate her chronicles
for her Lord will have inspired her.
On that day, mankind will issue forth in various groups to be shown their deeds.
So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it,
and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.
