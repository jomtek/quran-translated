In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful.
All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds,
the All-beneficent, the All-merciful,
Master of the Day of Retribution.
You [alone] do we worship, and to You [alone] do we turn for help.
Guide us on the straight path,
the path of those whom You have blessed â€” such as have not incurred Your wrath, nor are astray.
