The Catastrophe!
What is the Catastrophe?
What will show you what is the Catastrophe?
[It is] the day when mankind will be like scattered moths
and the mountains like carded wool.
As for him, whose deeds weigh heavy in the scales,
he will have a pleasing life.
But as for him, whose deeds weigh light in the scales,
his home will be the Abyss.
And what will show you what it is?
It is a scorching fire!
