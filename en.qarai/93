By the morning brightness,
and by the night when it is calm!
Your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor is He displeased with you,
and the Hereafter shall be better for you than the world.
Soon your Lord will give you [that with which] you will be pleased.
Did He not find you an orphan, and shelter you?
Did He not find you astray, and guide you?
Did He not find you needy, and enrich you?
So, as for the orphan, do not oppress him;
and as for the beggar, do not chide him;
and as for your Lordâ€™s blessing, proclaim it!
