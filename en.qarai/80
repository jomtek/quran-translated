He frowned and turned away
when the blind man approached him.
And how do you know, maybe he would purify himself,
or take admonition, and the admonition would benefit him!
But as for someone who is wealthy,
you attend to him,
though you are not liable if he does not purify himself.
But as for someone who comes hurrying to you,
while he fears [Allah],
you are neglectful of him.
No indeed! These [verses of the Quran ] are a reminder
—so let anyone who wishes remember—
in honoured scriptures,
exalted and purified,
in the hands of envoys,
noble and pious.
Perish man! How ungrateful is he!
From what did He create him?
He created him from a drop of [seminal] fluid; then proportioned him.
Then He made the way easy for him;
then He made him die and buried him;
and then, when He wished, resurrected him.
No indeed! He has not yet carried out what He has commanded him.
Let man consider his food:
We pour down plenteous water [from the sky],
then We split the earth making fissures in it
and make the grain grow in it,
as well as vines and vegetables,
olives and date palms,
and densely-planted gardens,
fruits and pastures,
as a sustenance for you and your livestock.
So when the deafening Cry comes—
the day when a man will evade his brother,
his mother and his father,
his spouse and his sons—
each of them will have a task to keep him preoccupied on that day.
Some faces will be bright on that day,
laughing and joyous,
and some faces on that day will be covered with dust,
overcast with gloom.
It is they who are the faithless, the vicious.
