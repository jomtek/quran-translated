By the heaven, and by the nightly visitor
(and what will show you what is the nightly visitor?
It is the brilliant star):
there is a guard over every soul.
So let man consider from what he was created.
He was created from an effusing fluid
which issues from between the loins and the breast-bones.
Indeed He is able to bring him back [after death],
on the day when the secrets are examined
and he shall have neither power nor helper.
By the resurgent heaven,
and by the furrowed earth:
it is indeed a conclusive discourse,
and not a jest.
Indeed they are devising a stratagem,
and I [too] am devising a plan.
So respite the faithless; give them a gentle respite.
