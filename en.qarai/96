Read in the Name of your Lord who created;
created man from a clinging mass.
Read, and your Lord is the most generous,
who taught by the pen,
taught man what he did not know.
Indeed man becomes rebellious
when he considers himself without need.
Indeed to your Lord is the return.
Tell me, he who forbids
a servant when he prays,
tell me, should he be on [true] guidance,
or bid [others] to Godwariness,
tell me, should he call him a liar and turn away
â€”does he not know that Allah sees [him]?
No indeed! If he does not cease, We shall seize him by the forelock,
a lying, sinful forelock!
Then let him call out his gang!
We [too] shall call the keepers of hell.
No indeed! Do not obey him, but prostrate and draw near [to Allah]!
