&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189. To God belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. God has power over all things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190. In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, are signs for people of understanding.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191. Those who remember God while standing, and sitting, and on their sides; and they reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth: “Our Lord, You did not create this in vain, glory to You, so protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”
