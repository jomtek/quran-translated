By the fig and the olive
and the Mount Sinai
and this land secure!
We indeed created Man in the fairest stature
then We restored him the lowest of the low --
save those who believe, and do righteous deeds; they shall have a wage unfailing.
What then shall cry thee lies as to the Doom?
Is not God the justest of judges?
