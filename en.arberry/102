Gross rivalry diverts you,
even till you visit the tombs.
No indeed; but soon you shall know.
Again, no indeed; but soon you shall know.
No indeed; did you know with the knowledge of certainty,
you shall surely see Hell;
Again, you shall surely see it with the eye of certainty
then you shall be questioned that day concerning true bliss.
