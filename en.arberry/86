By heaven and the night-star!
And what shall teach thee what is the night-star?
The piercing star!
Over every soul there is a watcher.
So let man consider of what he was created;
he was created of gushing water
issuing between the loins and the breast-bones.
Surely He is able to bring him back
upon the day when the secrets are tried,
and he shall have no strength, no helper.
By heaven of the returning rain,
by earth splitting with verdure,
surely it is a decisive word;
it is no merriment.
They are devising guile,
and I am devising guile.
So respite the unbelievers; delay with them awhile.
