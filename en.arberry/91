By the sun and his morning brightness
and by the moon when she follows him,
and by the day when it displays him
and by the night when it enshrouds him!
By the heaven and That which built it
and by the earth and That which extended it!
By the soul, and That which shaped it
and inspired it to lewdness and godfearing!
Prosperous is he who purifies it,
and failed has he who seduces it.
Thamood cried lies in their insolence
when the most wretched of them uprose,
then the Messenger of God said to them, 'The She-camel of God; let her drink!'
But they cried him lies, and hamstrung her, so their Lord crushed them for their sin, and leveled them:
and He fears not the issue thereof.
