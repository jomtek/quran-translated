Hast thou received the story of the Enveloper?
Faces on that day humbled,
labouring, toilworn,
roasting at a scorching fire,
watered at a boiling fountain,
no food for them but cactus thorn
unfattening, unappeasing hunger.
Faces on that day jocund,
with their striving well-pleased,
in a sublime Garden,
hearing there no babble;
therein a running fountain,
therein uplifted couches
and goblets set forth
and cushions arrayed
and carpets outspread.
What, do they not consider how the camel was created,
how heaven was lifted up,
how the mountains were hoisted,
how the earth was outstretched?
Then remind them! Thou art only a reminder;
thou art not charged to oversee them.
But he who turns his back, and disbelieves,
God shall chastise him with the greatest chastisement.
Truly, to Us is their return;
then upon Us shall rest their reckoning.
