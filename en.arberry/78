Of what do they question one another?
Of the mighty tiding
whereon they are at variance.
No indeed; they shall soon know!
Again, no indeed; they shall soon know!
Have We not made the earth as a cradle
and the mountains as pegs?
And We created you in pairs,
and We appointed your sleep for a rest;
and We appointed night for a garment,
and We appointed day for a livelihood.
And We have built above you seven strong ones,
and We appointed a blazing lamp
and have sent down out of the rainclouds water cascading
that We may bring forth thereby grain and plants,
and gardens luxuriant.
Surely the Day of Decision is an appointed time,
the day the Trumpet is blown, and you shall come in troops,
and heaven is opened, and become gates,
and the mountains are set in motion, and become a vapour.
Behold, Gehenna has become an ambush,
for the insolent a resort,
therein to tarry for ages,
tasting therein neither coolness nor any drink
save boiling water and pus
for a suitable recompense.
They indeed hoped not for a reckoning,
and they cried loud lies to Our signs;
and everything We have numbered in a Book.
'Taste! We shall increase you not save in chastisement.'
Surely for the godfearing awaits a place of security,
gardens and vineyards
and maidens with swelling breasts, like of age,
and a cup overflowing.
Therein they shall hear no idle talk, no cry of lies,
for a recompense from thy Lord, a gift, a reckoning,
Lord of the heavens and earth, and all that between them is, the All-merciful of whom they have no power to speak.
Upon the day when the Spirit and the angels stand in ranks they shall speak not, save him to whom the All-merciful has given leave, and who speaks aright.
That is the true day; so whosoever wills takes unto his Lord a resort.
Lo, We have warned you of a nigh chastisement, upon the day when a man shall behold what his hands have forwarded, and the unbeliever shall say, 'O would that I were dust!'
