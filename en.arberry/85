By heaven of the constellations,
by the promised day,
by the witness and the witnessed,
slain were the Men of the Pit,
the fire abounding in fuel,
when they were seated over it
and were themselves witnesses of what they did with the believers.
They took revenge on them only because they believed in the All-mighty, the Al-laudable,
God to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and God is Witness over everything.
Those who persecute the believers, men and women, and then have not repented, there awaits them the chastisement of Gehenna, and there awaits them the chastisement of the burning.
Those who believe, and do righteous deeds, for them await gardens underneath which rivers flow; that is the great triumph.
Surely thy Lord's assault is terrible.
Surely it is He who originates, and brings again,
and He is the All-forgiving, the All-loving,
Lord of the Throne, the All-glorious,
Performer of what He desires.
Hast thou received the story of the hosts,
Pharaoh and Thamood?
Nay, but the unbelievers still cry lies,
and God is behind them, encompassing.
Nay, but it is a glorious Koran,
in a guarded tablet.
