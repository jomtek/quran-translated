When the sun shall be darkened,
when the stars shall be thrown down,
when the mountains shall be set moving,
when the pregnant camels shall be neglected,
when the savage beasts shall be mustered,
when the seas shall be set boiling,
when the souls shall be coupled,
when the buried infant shall be asked
for what sin she was slain,
when the scrolls shall be unrolled,
when heaven shall be stripped off;
when Hell shall be set blazing,
when Paradise shall be brought nigh,
then shall a soul know what it has produced.
No! I swear by the slinkers,
the runners, the sinkers,
by the night swarming,
by the dawn sighing,
truly this is the word of a noble Messenger
having power, with the Lord of the Throne secure,
obeyed, moreover trusty.
Your companion is not possessed;
he truly saw him on the clear horizon;
he is not niggardly of the Unseen.
And it is not the word of an accursed Satan;
where then are you going?
It is naught but a Reminder unto all beings,
for whosoever of you who would go straight;
but will you shall not, unless God wills, the Lord of all Being.
