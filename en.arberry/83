Woe to the stinters who,
when they measure against the people, take full measure
but, when they measure for them or weigh for them, do skimp.
Do those not think that they shall be raised up
unto a mighty day
a day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of all Being?
No indeed; the Book of the libertines is in Sijjin;
and what shall teach thee what is Sijjin?
A book inscribed.
Woe that day unto those who cry it lies,
who cry lies to the Day of Doom;
and none cries lies to it but every guilty aggressor.
When our signs are recited to him, he says, 'Fairy-tales of the ancients!'
No indeed; but that they were earning has rusted upon their hearts.
No indeed; but upon that day they shall be veiled from their Lord,
then they shall roast in Hell.
Then it shall be said to them, 'This is that you cried lies to.'
No indeed; the book of the pious is in Illiyun;
and what shall teach thee what is Illiyun?
A book inscribed,
witnessed by those brought nigh.
Surely the pious shall be in bliss,
upon couches gazing;
thou knowest in their faces the radiancy of bliss
as they are given to drink of a wine sealed
whose seal is musk -- so after that let the strivers strive --
and whose mixture is Tasnim,
a fountain at which do drink those brought nigh.
Behold, the sinners were laughing at the believers,
when them passed them by winking at one another,
and when they returned to their people they returned blithely,
and when they saw them they said, 'Lo, these men are astray!'
Yet they were not sent as watchers over them.
So today the believers are laughing at the unbelievers,
upon couches gazing.
Have the unbelievers been rewarded what they were doing?
