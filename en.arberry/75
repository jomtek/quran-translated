No! I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
No! I swear by the reproachful soul.
What, does man reckon We shall not gather his bones?
Yes indeed; We are able to shape again his fingers.
Nay, but man desires to continue on as a libertine,
asking, 'When shall be the Day of Resurrection?'
But when the sight is dazed
and the moon is eclipsed,
and the sun and moon are brought together,
upon that day man shall say, 'Whither to flee?'
No indeed; not a refuge!
Upon that day the recourse shall be to thy Lord.
Upon that day man shall be told his former deeds and his latter;
nay, man shall be a clear proof against himself,
even though he offer his excuses.
Move not thy tongue with it to hasten it;
Ours it is to gather it, and to recite it.
So, when We recite it, follow thou its recitation.
Then Ours it is to explain it.
No indeed; but you love the hasty world,
and leave be the Hereafter.
Upon that day faces shall be radiant,
gazing upon their Lord;
and upon that day faces shall be scowling,
thou mightest think the Calamity has been wreaked on them.
No indeed; when it reaches the clavicles
and it is said, 'Who is an enchanter?'
and he thinks that it is the parting
and leg is intertwined with leg,
upon that day unto thy Lord shall be the driving.
For he confirmed it not, and did not pray,
but he cried it lies, and he turned away,
then he went to his household arrogantly.
Nearer to thee and nearer
then nearer to thee and nearer!
What, does man reckon he shall be left to roam at will?
Was he not a sperm-drop spilled?
Then he was a blood-clot, and He created and formed,
and He made of him two kinds, male and female.
What, is He not able to quicken the dead?
