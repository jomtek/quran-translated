No! I swear by this land,
and thou art a lodger in this land;
by the begetter, and that he begot,
indeed, We created man in trouble.
What, does he think none has power over him,
saying, 'I have consumed wealth abundant'?
What, does he think none has seen him?
Have We not appointed to him two eyes,
and a tongue, and two lips,
and guided him on the two highways?
Yet he has not assaulted the steep;
and what shall teach thee what is the steep?
The freeing of a slave,
or giving food upon a day of hunger
to an orphan near of kin
or a needy man in misery;
then that he become of those who believe and counsel each other to be steadfast, and counsel each other to be merciful.
Those are the Companions of the Right Hand.
And those who disbelieve in Our signs, they are the Companions of the Left Hand;
over them is a Fire covered down.
