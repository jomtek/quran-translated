By the dawn
and ten nights,
by the even and the odd,
by the night when it journeys on!
Is there in that an oath for a mindful man?
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord did with Ad,
Iram of the pillars,
the like of which was never created in the land,
and Thamood, who hollowed the rocks in the valley,
and Pharaoh, he of the tent-pegs,
who all were insolent in the land
and worked much corruption therein?
Thy Lord unloosed on them a scourge of chastisement;
surely thy Lord is ever on the watch.
As for man, whenever his Lord tries him, and honours him, and blesses him, then he says, 'My Lord has honoured me.'
But when he tries him and stints for him his provision, then he says, 'My Lord has despised me.'
No indeed; but you honour not the orphan,
and you urge not the feeding of the needy,
and you devour the inheritance greedily,
and you love wealth with an ardent love
No indeed! When the earth is ground to powder,
and thy Lord comes, and the angels rank on rank,
and Gehenna is brought out, upon that day man will remember; and how shall the Reminder be for him?
He shall say, 'O would that I had forwarded for my life!'
Upon that day none shall chastise as He chastises,
none shall bind as He binds.
'O soul at peace,
return unto thy Lord, well-pleased, well-pleasing!
Enter thou among My servants!
Enter thou My Paradise!'
