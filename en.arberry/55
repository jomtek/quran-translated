The All-merciful
has taught the Koran.
He created man
and He has taught him the Explanation.
The sun and the moon to a reckoning,
and the stars and the trees bow themselves;
and heaven -- He raised it up, and set the Balance.
(Transgress not in the Balance,
and weigh with justice, and skimp not in the Balance.)
And earth -- He set it down for all beings,
therein fruits, and palm-trees with sheaths,
and grain in the blade, and fragrant herbs.
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
He created man of a clay like the potter's,
and He created the jinn of a smokeless fire.

O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
O tribe of jinn and of men, if you are able to pass through the confines of heaven and earth, pass through them! You shall not pass through except with an authority.
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
Against you shall be loosed a flame of fire, and molten brass; and you shall not be helped.
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
And when heaven is split asunder, and turns crimson like red leather --
O which of our Lord's bounties will you and you deny?

therein two fountains of running water --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
therein of every fruit two kinds --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
reclining upon couches lined with brocade, the fruits of the gardens nigh to gather --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
therein maidens restraining their glances, untouched before them by any man or jinn --

lovely as rubies, beautiful as coral --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
Shall the recompense of goodness be other than goodness?
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?

therein two fountains of gushing water --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
therein fruits, and palm-trees, and pomegranates --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
therein maidens good and comely --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
houris, cloistered in cool pavilions --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
untouched before them by any man or jinn --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
reclining upon green cushions and lovely druggets --
O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?
Blessed be the Name of thy Lord, majestic, splendid.
