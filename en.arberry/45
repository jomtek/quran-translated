Ha Mim
The sending down of the Book is from God, the All-mighty, the All-wise.
Surely in the heavens and earth there are signs for the believers;
and in your creation, and the crawling things He scatters abroad, there are signs for a people having sure faith,
and in the alternation of night and day, and the provision God sends down from heaven, and therewith revives the earth after it is dead, and the turning about of the winds, there are signs for a people who understand.
Those are the signs of God that We recite to thee in truth; in what manner of discourse then, after God and His signs, will they believe?
Woe to every guilty impostor
who hears the signs of God being recited to him, then perseveres in waxing proud, as if he has not heard them; so give him the good tidings of a painful chastisement.
And when he knows anything of Our signs, he takes them in mockery; those for them awaits a humbling chastisement.
Behind them Gehenna; and that they have earned shall not avail them aught, nor those they took as protectors, apart from God; for them awaits a mighty chastisement.
This is guidance; and those who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord, there awaits them a painful chastisement of wrath.
God is He who has subjected to you the sea, that the ships may run on it at His commandment, and that you may seek His bounty; haply so you will be thankful.
And He has subjected to you what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, all together, from Him. Surely in that are signs for a people who reflect.
Say unto those who believe, that they forgive those who do not look for the days of God, that He may recompense a people for that they have been earning.
Whoso does righteousness, it is to his own gain, and whoso does evil, it is to his own loss; then to your Lord you shall be returned.
Indeed, We gave the Children of Israel the Book, the Judgment, and the Prophethood, and We provided them with good things, and We preferred them above all beings.
We gave them clear signs of the Command; so they differed not, except after the knowledge had come to them, being insolent one to another. Surely thy Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection touching their differences.
Then We set thee upon an open way of the Command; therefore follow it, and follow not the caprices of those who do not know.
Surely they will not avail thee aught against God. Surely the evildoers are friends one of the other; God is the friend of the godfearing.
This is clear proofs for men, and a guidance, and a mercy to a people having sure faith.
Or do those who commit evil deeds think that We shall make them as those who believe and do righteous deeds, equal their living and their dying? How ill they judge!
God created the heavens and the earth in truth, and that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned; they shall not be wronged.
Hast thou seen him who has taken his caprice to be his god, and God has led him astray out of a knowledge, and set a seal upon his hearing and his heart, and laid a covering on his eyes? Who shall guide him after God? What, will you not remember?
They say, 'There is nothing but our present life; we die, and we live, and nothing but Time destroys us.' Of that they have no knowledge; they merely conjecture.
And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, their only argument is that they say, 'Bring us our fathers, if you speak truly.'
Say: 'God gives you life, then makes you die, then He shall gather you to the Day of Resurrection, wherein is no doubt, but most men do not know.'
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And on the day when the Hour is come, upon that day the vain-doers shall lose.
And thou shalt see every nation hobbling on their knees, every nation being summoned unto its Book: 'Today you shall be recompensed for that you were doing.
This is Our Book, that speaks against you the truth; We have been registering all that you were doing.'
And as for those who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, their Lord shall admit them into His mercy; that is the manifest triumph.
But as for those who have disbelieved: 'Were not My signs recited to you, and you waxed proud, and were a sinful people?
And when it was said, "God's promise is true, and the Hour, there is no doubt of it," you said; "We know not what the Hour may be; we have only a surmise, and are by no means certain."
And the evil deeds that they have done shall appear to them, and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked at.
And it shall be said, 'Today We do forget you, even as you forgot the encounter of this your day; and your refuge is the Fire, and you shall have no helpers.
That is for that you took God's signs in mockery, and the present life deluded you.' So today they shall not be brought forth from it, nor will they be suffered to make amends.
So to God belongs praise, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, Lord of all Being.
His is the Domination an the heavens and the earth; He is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
