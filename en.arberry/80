He frowned and turned away
that the blind man came to him.
And what should teach thee? Perchance he would cleanse him,
or yet remember, and the Reminder profit him.
But the self-sufficient,
to him thou attendest
though it is not thy concern, if he does not cleanse himself.
And he who comes to thee eagerly
and fearfully,
to him thou payest no heed.
No indeed; it is a Reminder
(and whoso wills, shall remember it)
upon pages high-honoured,
uplifted, purified,
by the hands of scribes
noble, pious.
Perish Man! How unthankful he is!
Of what did He create him?
Of a sperm-drop He created him, and determined him,
then the way eased for him,
then makes him to die, and buries him,
then, when He wills, He raises him.
No indeed! Man has not accomplished His bidding.
Let Man consider his nourishment.
We poured out the rains abundantly,
then We split the earth in fissures
and therein made the grains to grow
and vines, and reeds,
and olives, and palms,
and dense-tree'd gardens,
and fruits, and pastures,
an enjoyment for you and your flocks.
And when the Blast shall sound,
upon the day when a man shall flee from his brother,
his mother, his father,
his consort, his sons,
every man that day shall have business to suffice him.
Some faces on that day shall shine
laughing, joyous;
some faces on that day shall be dusty
o'erspread with darkness --
those -- they are the unbelievers, the libertines.
