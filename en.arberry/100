By the snorting chargers,
by the strikers of fire,
by the dawn-raiders
blazing a trail of dust,
cleaving there with a host!
Surely Man is ungrateful to his Lord,
and surely he is a witness against that!
Surely he is passionate in his love for good things.
Knows he not that when that which is in the tombs is over-thrown,
and that which is in the breasts is brought out --
surely on that day their Lord shall be aware of them!
