Magnify the Name of thy Lord the Most High
who created and shaped,
who determined and guided,
who brought forth the pasturage
then made it a blackening wrack.
We shall make thee recite, to forget not
save what God wills; surely He knows what is spoken aloud and what is hidden.
We shall ease thee unto the Easing.
Therefore remind, if the Reminder profits,
and he who fears shall remember,
but the most wretched shall flout it,
even he who shall roast in the Great Fire,
then he shall neither die therein, nor live.
Prosperous is he who has cleansed himself,
and mentions the Name of his Lord, and prays.
Nay, but you prefer the present life;
and the world to come is better, and more enduring.
Surely this is in the ancient scrolls,
the scrolls of Abraham and Moses.
