When heaven is split open,
when the stars are scattered,
when the seas swarm over,
when the tombs are overthrown,
then a soul shall know its works, the former and the latter.
O Man! What deceived thee as to thy generous Lord
who created thee and shaped thee and wrought thee in symmetry
and composed thee after what form He would?
No indeed; but you cry lies to the Doom;
yet there are over you watchers
noble, writers
who know whatever you do.
Surely the pious shall be in bliss,
and the libertines shall be in a fiery furnace
roasting therein on the Day of Doom,
nor shall they ever be absent from it.
And what shall teach thee what is the Day of Doom?
Again, what shall teach thee what is the Day of Doom?
A day when no soul shall possess aught to succour another soul; that day the Command shall belong unto God.
