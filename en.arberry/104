Woe unto every backbiter, slanderer,
who has gathered riches and counted them over
thinking his riches have made him immortal!
No indeed; he shall be thrust into the Crusher;
and what shall teach thee what is the Crusher;
The Fire of God kindled
roaring over the hearts
covered down upon them,
in columns outstretched.
