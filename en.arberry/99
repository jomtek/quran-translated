When earth is shaken with a mighty shaking
and earth brings forth her burdens,
and Man says., 'What ails her?'
upon that day she shall tell her tidings
for that her Lord has inspired her.
Upon that day men shall issue in scatterings to see their works,
and whoso has done an atom's weight of good shall see it,
and whoso has done an atom's weight of evil shall see it.
