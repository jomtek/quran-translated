All that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies God, the King, the All-holy, the All-mighty, the All-wise.
It is He who has raised up from among the common people a Messenger from among them, to recite His signs to them and to purify them, and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom, though before that they were in manifest error,
and others of them who have not yet joined them. And He is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
That is the bounty of God; He gives it to whom He will, and God is of bounty abounding.
The likeness of those who have been loaded with the Torah then they have not carried it, is as the likeness of an ass carrying books. Evil is the likeness of the people who have cried lies to God's signs. God guides never the people of the evildoers.
Say: 'You of Jewry, if you assert that you are the friends of God, apart from other men, then do you long for death, if you speak truly.'
But they will never long for it, because of that their hands have forwarded; God knows the evildoers.
Say: 'Surely death, from which you flee, shall encounter you; then you shall be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, and He will tell you that you have been doing.'
O believers, when proclamation is made for prayer on the Day of Congregation, hasten to God's remembrance and leave trafficking aside; that is better for you, did you but know.
Then, when the prayer is finished, scatter in the land and seek God's bounty, and remember God frequently; haply you will prosper.
But when they see merchandise or diversion they scatter off to it, and they leave thee standing. Say: 'What is with God is better than diversion and merchandise. God is the best of providers.'
