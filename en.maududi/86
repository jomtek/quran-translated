By the heaven, and the night-visitor,
what do you know what the night-visitor is?
It is the piercing star.
There is no living being but there is a protector over it.
So let man consider of what he was created.
He was created of a gushing fluid,
emanating from between the loins and the ribs.
Surely He (the Creator) has the power to bring him back (to life).
On the Day when man's deepest secrets shall be put to the test
he shall have no power, and no helper.
By the heaven with its recurring cycle of rain,
and by the earth ever bursting with verdure,
this (Qur'an) is surely a decisive Word,
not a flippant jest.
They are devising a guile,
and I too am devising a guile.
So leave the unbelievers to themselves; respite them awhile.
