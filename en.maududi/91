By the sun and its heat and brightness,
and by the moon as it follows it;
and by the day as it displays the sun's glory,
and by the night as it envelopes the sun;
and by the sky and by Him Who made it;
and by the earth and by Him Who stretched it out;
and by the soul and by Him Who perfectly proportioned it,
and imbued it with (the consciousness of) its evil and its piety:
He who purifies it will prosper,
and he who suppresses it will be ruined.
In their presumptuous insolence the Thamud called the Truth a lie
when their arch-criminal rose up in rage.
Then Allah's Messenger warned them: “Hands off the she-camel and her drink!”
But they rejected his statement as a lie and hamstrung the she-camel. For that crime their Lord rumbled down upon them, utterly razing them to the ground.
He has no fear of its sequel.
