Nay! I swear by this city
– this city wherein you have been rendered violable–
and I swear by the parent and his offspring:
Verily We have created man into toil and hardship.
Does he think that no one can overpower him?
He says: “I have squandered enormous wealth.”
Does he believe that none has seen him?
Did We not grant him two eyes,
and a tongue and two lips?
And did We not show him the two highroads (of good and evil)?
But he did not venture to scale the difficult steep.
And what do you know what that difficult steep is?
It is freeing someone's neck from slavery;
or giving food on a day of hunger
to an orphan near of kin;
or to a destitute lying in dust;
and, then besides this, he be one of those who believed, and enjoined upon one another steadfastness and enjoined upon one another compassion.
These are the People of the Right Hand.
As for those who rejected Our Signs, they are the People of the Left Hand.
Upon them shall be a Fire that will hem them in.
