(O Prophet), Did We not lay open your breast
and relieve you of the burden
that had well-nigh broken your back?
And did We not exalt your fame?
Indeed, there is ease with hardship.
Most certainly, there is ease with hardship.
So, whenever you are free, strive in devotion,
and turn to your Lord with longing.
