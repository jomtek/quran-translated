When the earth will be shaken with a mighty shaking,
and the earth will throw up all her burdens,
and man will cry out: “What is the matter with her?”
On that Day it will relate all her news,
for your Lord will have commanded her (to do so).
On that Day people will go forth in varying states so that they be shown their deeds.
So, whoever does an atom's weight of good shall see it;
and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall see it.
