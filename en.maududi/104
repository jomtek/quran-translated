Woe to every fault-finding backbiter;
who amasses wealth and counts it over and again.
He thinks that his wealth will immortalise him forever.
Nay, he shall be thrown into the Crusher.
And what do you know what the Crusher is?
It is the Fire kindled by Allah,
the Fire that shall rise to the hearts (of criminals).
Verily it will close in upon them,
in outstretched columns.
