Has the news of the overwhelming event reached you?
Some faces that Day shall be downcast with fear,
be toiling and worn-out;
they shall burn in a Scorching Fire;
their drink shall be from a boiling spring.
They shall have no food except bitter dry thorns
that will neither nourish nor satisfy their hunger.
On that very Day some faces shall be radiant with joy,
well-pleased with their striving.
They will be in a lofty Garden
wherein they shall hear no vain talk.
In it there shall be a flowing spring,
and couches raised high,
and goblets laid out,
and cushions arrayed in rows,
and rich carpets levelled out.
Do (these unbelievers) not observe the camels: how they were created?
And the sky: how it was raised high?
And the mountains: how they were fixed?
And the earth: how it was spread out?
So render good counsel, for you are simply required to counsel,
and are not invested with the authority to compel them.
But whoever will turn away (from the Truth),
Allah will chastise him with the most terrible chastisement.
Surely to Us is their return;
and then it is for Us to call them to account.
