The Calamity!
What is the Calamity?
And what do you know what the Calamity is?
On that Day human beings shall be like scattered moths,
and the mountains shall be like fluffs of carded wool in varying colours.
Then he whose scales weigh heavier
shall have a blissful life;
but he whose scales weigh lighter,
his shall be the deep pit for a dwelling.
And what do you know what that is?
A Blazing Fire!
