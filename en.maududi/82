When the heaven is split asunder,
when the stars are scattered,
when the seas are made to burst forth,
and when graves are laid open,
everyone shall know all his deeds, both the earlier and the later.
O man! What has deceived you about your generous Lord
Who created you, shaped you, and made you well-proportioned,
and set you in whatever form He pleased?
No indeed; (the fact is that) you deny the Reckoning, declaring it a lie;
you do so the while there are watchers over you;
noble scribes,
who know what you do.
Surely the virtuous shall be in Bliss,
and the wicked shall be in the Blazing Fire.
They shall enter it on the Day of Recompense
and then shall never come out of it.
What do you know what the Day of Recompense is?
Again, what do you know what the Day of Recompense is?
It is the Day when no one shall have the power to do anything for another, and all command shall be Allah's.
