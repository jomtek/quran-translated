(O Prophet), when the hypocrites come to you, they say: “We bear witness that you are certainly Allah's Messenger.” Allah certainly knows that you are His Messenger. But Allah also bears witness that the hypocrites are utter liars!
They shelter behind their oath, and thus hinder their own selves and others from the Path of Allah. Evil indeed is what they do.
All that is because they first believed and then disbelieved, and therefore a seal was set on their hearts; as a result they understand nothing.
When you look at them, their persons are pleasing, and when they speak, you pay heed to what they say. But in truth they are (merely) beams of timber propped-up (against a wall). They consider every shout they hear to be directed against them. They are your utter enemies; guard against them. May Allah do away with them! How are they being turned away (from the Truth)?
When it is said to them: “Come, Allah's Messenger will seek forgiveness for you,” they (contemptuously) shake their heads and you see them holding back in pride.
It is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or not; for Allah shall never forgive them. Surely Allah does not direct the transgressing folk to the Right Way.
It is they who say: “Give nothing to those who are with the Messenger of Allah so that they may disperse.” (They say so although) the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah. But the hypocrites do not understand.
They say: “When we return to Madinah, the honourable ones will drive out from it those that are abject.” In truth, all honour belongs to Allah, and to His Messenger, and to the believers. But the hypocrites do not know.
Believers, let your possessions and your offspring not make you negligent of Allah's remembrance. For whoso does that, they will be the losers.
And spend of what Allah has granted you by way of sustenance before death should come to any of you and he should say: “Lord, why did You not defer my return for a while so that I might give alms and be among the righteous?”
But when a person's term comes to an end, Allah never grants any respite. Allah is well aware of all that you do.
