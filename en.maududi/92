By the night when it enshrouds,
and by the day when it breaks in its glory,
and by Him Who created the male and the female:
surely your strivings are divergent.
As for him who gave out his wealth (for Allah's sake) and abstained (from disobeying Him),
and affirmed the Truth of goodness:
We shall facilitate for him the Way to Bliss.
As for him who was a miser and behaved with aversion (to Allah),
and denied the Truth of goodness:
We shall facilitate for him the way to Hardship,
and his wealth shall be of no avail to him when he perishes.
Surely it is for Us to show the Right Way,
and to Us belong the Next Life and the present.
I have now warned you of a Blazing Fire,
where none shall burn except the most wicked,
who rejected the Truth, calling it falsehood and turned his back on it.
But the God-fearing shall be kept away from it,
the Godfearing who spends his wealth to purify himself;
not as payment for any favours that he received,
but only to seek the good pleasure of his Lord Most High.
He will surely be well-pleased (with him).
