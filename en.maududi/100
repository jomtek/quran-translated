By (the horses) that charge snorting,
then raise sparks of fire (by their hoofs),
then raid by the dawn,
and blaze a trail of dust,
and penetrate deep into a host.
Verily man is most ungrateful to his Lord;
and he himself is a witness to that,
and surely he loves riches with a passionate loving.
Is he not aware that when whatever lies (buried) in the graves is overthrown;
and the secrets of the hearts are laid bare (and examined)?
Surely on that Day will their Lord be fully informed about them.
