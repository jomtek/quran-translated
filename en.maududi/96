Recite in the name of your Lord Who created,
created man from a clot of congealed blood.
Recite: and your Lord is Most Generous,
Who taught by the pen,
taught man what he did not know.
Nay, surely man transgresses;
for he believes himself to be self-sufficient.
Surely to your Lord is your return.
Did you see him who forbids
a servant (of Allah) when he prays?
Did you consider: what if he is on the Right Way,
and enjoins piety?
Did you consider: what if he gives the lie (to the Truth) and turns away (from it)?
Does he not know that Allah sees everything?
No indeed; if he does not desist, We shall drag him by the forelock;
by the lying forelock steeped in sin.
So let him summon his helpmates;
We too shall summon the guards of Hell.
No, not at all. Never obey him. But prostrate yourself and become nigh (to your Lord).
