By the bright forenoon,
and by the night when it covers the world with peace:
(O Prophet), your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor is He displeased.
Indeed what is to come will be better for you than what has gone by.
Verily your Lord will soon give you so amply that you will be well-pleased.
Did He not find you an orphan and then gave you shelter?
Did He not find you unaware of the Right Way, and then directed you to it?
And did He not find you in want, and then enriched you?
Therefore, be not harsh with the orphan;
and chide not him who asks,
and proclaim the bounty of your Lord.
