In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the entire universe.
The Merciful, the Compassionate
The Master of the Day of Recompense.
You alone do we worship, and You alone do we turn for help
Direct us on to the Straight Way,
The way of those whom You have favoured, who did not incur Your wrath, who are not astray.
