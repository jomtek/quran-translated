When the sky is rent asunder
and hearkens to the command of its Lord, doing what it should;
and when the earth is stretched out
and casts out what is within it and is emptied,
and hearkens to the command of its Lord, doing what it should.
O man, you are striving unto your Lord and you will meet Him.
Whoever is given the Record in his right hand
shall be called to an easy accounting,
and shall return to his people joyfully.
But he who is given the Record behind his back,
shall cry for “perdition,”
and will enter the Blazing Fire.
He used to live joyfully among his people,
thinking he would never revert (to Us).
But no; (how would he not revert)? His Lord was ever watching him.
Nay; I swear by the twilight;
and by the night and what it enfolds,
and by the moon, when it reaches its fullness:
you shall proceed onwards from stage to stage.
So, what is the matter with them that they do not believe,
and when the Qur'an is recited to them, they do not prostrate themselves?
Instead, the unbelievers reject it, calling it a lie.
Allah knows best what they are accumulating (in their Record).
So give them the good news of a painful chastisement,
except for those who believe and do good deeds. Theirs shall be an unending reward.
