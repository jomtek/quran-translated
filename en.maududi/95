By the fig and the olive;
and by the Mount Sinai,
and by this city (of Makkah), a haven of peace:
surely We created man in the best mould;
then We reverted him to the lowest of the low,
except those who have faith and do righteous deeds. Theirs is a never ending reward.
Who, then, can give the lie to you, (O Prophet), about the Reward and the Punishment?
Is not Allah the Greatest of all sovereigns?
