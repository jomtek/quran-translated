Did you see him who gives the lie to the Reward and Punishment of the Hereafter?
Such is the one who repulses the orphans away,
and urges not the feeding of the needy.
Woe, then, to those who pray,
but are heedless in their Prayers,
those who do good (in order) to be seen,
and deny people the articles of common necessity.
