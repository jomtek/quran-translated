Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,
Who created all things and fashioned them in good proportion;
Who determined and guided them,
Who brought forth the pasture,
and then made it into a blackish straw.
We shall make you recite and then you will not forget,
except what Allah should wish. He knows all that is manifest and all that is hidden.
We shall ease you to follow the way of Ease.
So render good counsel if good counsel will avail.
He who fears (Allah) shall heed it,
but the wretched will turn away from it.
He will be cast into the Great Fire.
Then he will neither die in it, nor live.
He who purified himself shall prosper,
remembering his Lord's name and praying.
No; but you prefer the present life,
whereas the Hereafter is better and more enduring.
This, indeed, was in the ancient Scrolls,
the Scrolls of Abraham and Moses.
