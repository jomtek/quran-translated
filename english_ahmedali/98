THOSE AMONG THE people of the Book who disbelieve, and the idolaters, would not have been freed (from false beliefs) until the clear proof came to them --
An Apostle from God, reading out hallowed pages
Containing firm decrees.
The people of the Book were not divided among themselves till after the clear proof had come to them.
They were commanded only to serve God with all-exclusive faith in Him, to be upright, and to fulfil their devotional obligations, and to give zakat; for this is the even way.
Surely the unbelievers among the people of the Book and the idolaters, will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.
But those who believe and do the right are surely the best of created beings,
Whose reward is with their Lord -- gardens of Eden with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever, God pleased with their service, they with obedience to Him. This (awaits) him who stands in awe of his Lord.
