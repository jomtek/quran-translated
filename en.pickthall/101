The Calamity!
What is the Calamity?
Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Calamity is!
A day wherein mankind will be as thickly-scattered moths
And the mountains will become as carded wool.
Then, as for him whose scales are heavy (with good works),
He will live a pleasant life.
But as for him whose scales are light,
A bereft and Hungry One will be his mother,
Ah, what will convey unto thee what she is! -
Raging Fire.
