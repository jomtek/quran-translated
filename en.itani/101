The Shocker.
What is the Shocker?
What will explain to you what the Shocker is?
The Day when the people will be like scattered moths.
And the mountains will be like tufted wool.
As for he whose scales are heavy.
He will be in a pleasant life.
But as for he whose scales are light.
His home is the Abyss.
Do you know what it is?
A Raging Fire.
