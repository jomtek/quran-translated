Woe to every slanderer backbiter.
Who gathers wealth and counts it over.
Thinking that his wealth has made him immortal.
By no means. He will be thrown into the Crusher.
And what will make you realize what the Crusher is?
God's kindled Fire.
That laps to the hearts.
It closes in on them.
In extended columns.
