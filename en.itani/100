By the racers panting.
Igniting sparks.
Raiding at dawn.
Raising clouds of dust.
Storming into the midst.
Indeed, the human being is ungrateful to his Lord.
And he bears witness to that.
And he is fierce in his love of wealth.
Does he not know? When the contents of the graves are scattered around.
And the contents of the hearts are obtained.
Their Lord, on that Day, is fully informed of them.
